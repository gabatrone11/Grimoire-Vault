Elemental analysis is the root of astrological interpretations. The four
astrological elements are Fire, Earth, Air, and Water. The four elements
alternate around the zodiac wheel, beginning at Aries and House 1 with
Fire, then Earth, then Air, then Water, and back to Fire, then Earth,
Air, Water, and again Fire, Earth, Air, and Water, and so on.

| **Aries**  | Fire  | **Libra**       | Air   |
|------------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **Taurus** | Earth | **Scorpio**     | Water |
| **Gemini** | Air   | **Sagittarius** | Fire  |
| **Cancer** | Water | **Capricorn**   | Earth |
| **Leo**    | Fire  | **Aquarius**    | Air   |
| **Virgo**  | Earth | **Pisces**      | Water |

| **House 1** | Fire  | **House 7**  | Air   |
|-------------|-------|--------------|-------|
| **House 2** | Earth | **House 8**  | Water |
| **House 3** | Air   | **House 9**  | Fire  |
| **House 4** | Water | **House 10** | Earth |
| **House 5** | Fire  | **House 11** | Air   |
| **House 6** | Earth | **House 12** | Water |

In medieval astrology, the elemental basis for the twelve zodiac signs
were further characterized as Positive, Common, or Negative, called
trinocracies. The first trinocracy formed a set of signs consisting of
all four elements, and this first set was the Positive Set. The second
trinocracy of the zodiac formed the Common Set. The final trinocracy was
the Negative set.

<span class="smallcaps">The Elemental Trinocracies</span>

| **Positive Set** |                | **Common Set** |              | **Negative Set** |                |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Aries**        | Positive Fire  | **Leo**        | Common Fire  | **Sagittarius**  | Negative Fire  |
| **Taurus**       | Positive Earth | **Virgo**      | Common Earth | **Capricorn**    | Negative Earth |
| **Gemini**       | Positive Air   | **Libra**      | Common Air   | **Aquarius**     | Negative Air   |
| **Cancer**       | Positive Water | **Scorpio**    | Common Water | **Pisces**       | Negative Water |

The trinocratic quality of each element would be represented by three of
the zodiac signs. The trinocracies are not the same as the three
modalities, though comparisons are drawn between the two. Both follow
the wheel of the year, but modalities refer to when within each equinox
or solstice the zodiac falls, whereas trinocracies refer to the quadrant
or consecutive months conceding with particular seasons. The Positive
Set, for instance, consisting of Fire (Aries), Earth (Taurus), Gemini
(Air), and Cancer (Water) are spring and summer; the Common Set,
consisting of Leo (Fire), Virgo (Earth), Libra (Air), and Scorpio
(Water) are the consecutive months of late summer and autumn.

| **Fire**  |               | **Earth** |                | **Air**   |              | **Water** |                |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Aries** | Positive Fire | **Taur.** | Positive Earth | **Gem.**  | Positive Air | **Canc.** | Positive Water |
| **Leo**   | Common Fire   | **Virgo** | Common Earth   | **Libra** | Common Air   | **Scor.** | Common Water   |
| **Sagi.** | Negative Fire | **Capr.** | Negative Earth | **Aqua.** | Negative Air | **Pisc.** | Negative Water |

Since trinocracies have fallen out of favor among 21st century
astrologers and in place of trinocratic quality astrologers focus on
modality, no further discussion will be provided on trinocracies. The
topic is included here to round out the discussion on elements in
astrology. However, when using astrology for divination, trinocracies
can be observed. Divinatory results yielding a zodiac sign from the
Positive set will indicate a positive outcome or “yes.” The Common set
indicates neutrality. The Negative set will indicate a “no” and
additional efforts must be exerted if a favorable outcome is desired.
Horary astrology, or using astrology for divination, will be discussed
later in this course.

The four elements are the fundamental building blocks of energy. Every
individual is a unique balance of all four, Fire, Earth, Air, and Water.
However, the specific balance of the four elements in each individual is
unique. Some will be Fire-dominant; others Water-weak; still others with
two or more elements of equal dominance or weakness. The whole of
astrological interpretations is built upon elemental analysis.

Fire brings energy, vitality, confidence, motivation, enthusiasm,
leadership, innovation, and a pioneering character. Fire is what gives
you drive and determines the strength of your willpower. Too much
Fire—everything you touch will burn. Too little Fire—it becomes a
challenge for you to launch any endeavor off the ground.

Water is all about spirituality, the conviction of our faith,
compassion, our emotional sensitivity, and creative intuition. It is
through Water that you are able to relate to people. It symbolizes the
parabolic quest for the Holy Grail within each of us, how we connect to
heaven, to the earth around us, and to fellow man. Too much Water—there
is insufficient substance. Too little Water—you lack sentimentality.

Air is what makes us analytical, logical creatures. It gives us our
intelligence, ability to communicate and express philosophy, and it is
that drive within us to seek truth and knowledge. Too much Air—our own
egos become our undoing. Too little Air—we don’t engage in the
collective discourse of ideas.

Earth reveals how connected we are to the material realm. It is about
our resources, how we use those resources, goal-seeking, industry, and
tillage. Earth is what gives us financial security. Too much Earth—our
own conservatism hinders our advancement. We become rigid and
short-sighted. Too little Earth—we have no foundation to build on.

We are all of these traits bundled into one spirit and body, but some
traits will dominate over others inherently. That is where elemental
analysis comes in. To strike balance, where you are dominant, you want
to temper. Where you are weak, you want to nurture to be strong.

Spiritual chemistry is also rooted in elemental analysis. Interpreting
an astrology chart is rooted in the spiritual chemistry of elemental
analysis, also referred to as elemental dignities. Not only do you need
to determine the balance of Fire, Earth, Air, and Water in a chart, but
you’ll also want to examine the points where these elements converge
with one another. Certain points of convergence produce strengths.
Certain points produce weaknesses. We will first cover the basic
correspondences of the four elements and then address elemental
dignities.

The twelve signs of the Western zodiac are subdivided into four
triplicities, by their governing elements—the Fire Triplicity, the Earth
Triplicity, the Air Triplicity, and the Water Triplicity. Each sign in
each Triplicity is 120° apart from the other. The Triplicities are as
follows:

Those from the Fire Triplicity are inspirational. They’re confident and
take control. They’re pioneers. Those from the Earth Triplicity are
goal-oriented, loyal, and practical. If you’re part of the Air
Triplicity, then you’re a thinker, albeit indecisive at times;
analytical, and social. Those of the Water Triplicity are intuitive,
artistic, and sensitive. Signs from the Fire and Air Triplicities are
considered “masculine” or more yang. Signs from the Earth and Water
Triplicities are “feminine” or more yin.

I am convinced that it is not possible to master any metaphysical or
sacred art without strong foundational knowledge of elements, or the
concept of essential nature. In Eastern metaphysics, essential nature is
characterized as the Wu Xing, five phases, and the Ba Gua, or eight
elemental trigrams that all nature and every facet of the universe is
comprised of. Whether it’s feng shui, divination, martial arts, or
Traditional Chinese Medicine and herbal healing, a metaphysical or
holistic practitioner must understand essential nature, or elements.
Likewise, in Western metaphysics, from alchemy and witchcraft to forms
of holistic healing, tarot divination, and astrology, understanding of
the craft must begin with understanding of essential nature, which in
Western constructs is characterized as the four elements, Fire, Earth,
Air, and Water.

Do not proceed beyond this chapter on the Four Elements until you are
confident with your proficiency on the subject matter. All of astrology
can be reduced to one single purpose: to understand essential nature.
Thus, every facet of astrology will at some point circle back to
elemental analysis. You must understand the four elements and their
interplay before proceeding.

He brings to attention the dangerous aspects of sin and urges purification through holiness.    | **Protection from Evil**: Fire, with its destructive power, reminds people of Michael's role as heaven's top warrior angel, combating evil with the greater power of good.

## Three Modalities

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image18.jpeg"
style="width:5.69341in;height:5.64384in" />

| MODALITY     | **Fire**    | **Earth** | **Air**  | **Water** |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Cardinal** | Aries       | Capricorn | Libra    | Cancer    |
| **Fixed**    | Leo         | Taurus    | Aquarius | Scorpio   |
| **Mutable**  | Sagittarius | Virgo     | Gemini   | Pisces    |

Determining Modality

To determine the balance of modality in an astrological chart, use the
analysis table below to run through a step by step analysis. Begin by
locating the ascendant in the chart. Note the zodiac sign of the
ascendant. Is that sign Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable? Mark a single tally
point for the modality of the ascendant. Then continue on to the
midheaven sign, then the zodiac sign that the sun is in, and so on until
the final row of the analysis table. Then tally each column and the
column with the most points is the dominant modality of the chart. The
column with the last points is the weakest modality of the chart.

## Chart Shape Analysis

If you zoom out and take a look at the overall chart pattern that is
formed by the luminaries and planets in your chart, we can likewise get
a sense of your general personality pattern. Interpreting the overall
chart shape seems to be a modern astrological invention, one traced back
to renowned modern astrologer Dr. Marc Edmund Jones (October 1, 1888 –
March 5, 1980).

According to Dr. Jones, there are six main chart shapes plus a seventh,
the Unclassified. The six main chart shapes are the Bowl, the Bundle,
the Locomotive, the Seesaw, and the Splay. Chart shape is determined by
analyzing the overall arrangement of major planets and celestial bodies
in the chart.

Which celestial bodies are part of the consideration for chart shape
will vary from astrologer to astrologer. Use the following eleven
celestial bodies for consideration of chart shape:

**The Bowl**

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image29.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

Bowl in the Southern Hemisphere

A Bowl is when all planets gather along one half of the zodiac wheel, or
one of the hemispheres. The Bowl shape reveals one born with a single,
clear, and distinct mission in life, a clear somewhat indelible sense of
drive. If there is one thing you can be sure of, one message you take
away from the chart analysis, it is that a native with a Bowl chart
shape will have one mission in this lifetime and the Bowl shape reveals
that mission.

Bowls are one of the more common chart shapes (though each Bowl is
different, and there are as many Bowl patterns as whatever the
permutation of hemispheres, signs, and planets are) and on a broader
philosophical plane, affirm the notion that there *is* a Divine Plan for
each one of us, that we are brought here with a set purpose, a mission
ordained upon us by a Divine.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image30.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

Bowl in the Western Hemisphere

The hemisphere, be that northern, southern, eastern, or western,
indicates the area in which the native will serve out that mission. In
the northern hemisphere—the native’s life purpose and greater mission as
assigned to him or her by Divinity is for the collective, to have a
public presence; in the southern—it is related to a personal
achievement, a Great Work, producing one single masterpiece. In the
eastern hemisphere—like the southern hemisphere, it’s related to glory
and achieving something that will be recognized on a public platform; in
the western—it can be about true love, children, family, love, Love with
the capital L, and teaching or nurturing others.

Review the hemisphere correspondences and analysis from the previous
section on the Anatomy of a Tropical Zodiac. A Bowl’s hemisphere
dominance denotes important markers of purpose corresponding with that
hemisphere’s astrological interpretation.

Bowl charts will have a lead planet. The lead planet is the first planet
in line in the series of planets that occupy the hemisphere. Going in
order of the houses, House 1, House 2, House 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on,
locate the first house that the first planet of the Bowl begins at. That
first planet is the lead planet. In the first Bowl diagram of this
section, the lead planet begins in House 7. In the preceding Bowl
diagram or the second diagram of this section, the lead planet begins in
House 4.

**The Bundle**

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image31.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

Bundle Formed in Houses 9, 10, 11, and 12

A Bundle is when all planets are gathered within a range of 120° while
the rest of the chart is empty. That means in a Whole Signs chart, all
major celestial bodies gather only in four consecutive houses. When
reading a Placidus chart, you’ll need to calculate the total degree of
range to confirm it is within 120°.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image32.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

Bundle Formed in Houses 3, 4, 5, and 6

The Bundle reveals a native with a highly specialized skill set. There
is but one clear mission, one defined purpose for this native’s life
path. Those with a Bundle chart pattern seem to be programmed with one
clear goal, and that goal is often revealed in the midheaven sign of the
chart. When the chart shape is the Bundle, look to hemisphere dominance
to get a sense for the objectives and motivations of that specialized
mission. The four astrological houses that the Bundle is domiciled in
reveal the four strongest areas of life for that native and the areas of
life where the native will find innate talents, blessings, and personal
power.

If a native is unclear where to begin the search for finding those
innate talents, blessings, and reservoirs of personal power, or if an
astrological chart you’re reading is a Bundle and you want to identify
the secret powers for the inquiry that the chart references, then look
to the lead planet. The lead planet is the first planet in line in the
series of planets that form the Bundle. Going in order of the houses,
House 1, House 2, House 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on, locate the first house
that the first planet of the Bundle starts at. That first planet is the
lead planet. That lead planet is a hint from the Divine for where to
begin the search and discovery for the secret powers.

In the first Bundle diagram of this section, the lead planet begins in
House 9. Whatever that lead planet is in the chart is going to be the
planet you interpret for revealing the location, identity, character, or
source of the secret powers that the Bundle prognosticates. In the
second Bundle diagram of this section, the lead planet begins in House
3. That first planet in House 3, at the earliest degree, close to House
2, is going to be the planet that reveals keys to finding, identifying,
or uncovering innate talents, blessings, and reservoirs of personal
power.

**The Locomotive**

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image33.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

The Locomotive Chart Shape

Along with the Bowl, the Locomotive is one of the more common chart
shapes. It occurs when two thirds of the zodiac wheel is occupied by
planets but one third remains empty. In a whole signs chart, that means
in a Whole Signs chart, a consecutive eight of the twelve houses are
occupied and there are four consecutive empty houses in the chart.
However, one exception to the rule is if the last house in the
Locomotive only bears one planet and the chart shape might not fit
within the scope of any other chart shape, it would still be counted as
a Locomotive, even if it only has three consecutive empty houses. In the
above chart, for example, only three consecutive houses are empty, yet
it is still considered a Locomotive.

To determine a Locomotive, look for four consecutive empty houses and if
there are only three consecutive empty houses, then confirm that the
tail end of the Locomotive is only one planet occupying that last house.
In a Placidus chart, assess the Locomotive by the house wheel, not the
zodiac signs wheel.

Statistically, the Bowl and the Locomotive are the two most common chart
shapes among natives. These commonalities between the Bowl and
Locomotive reveal a broader philosophical message, one affirming the
notion that there *is* a Divine Plan for each one of us, that we are
brought here with a set purpose, a mission—though whether we choose to
accept that mission is the point where destiny ends and free will
begins.

The difference between the Bowl and the Locomotive is that there is a
steadiness of progression to the Bowl, whereas with the Locomotive, the
native seems to bumble, careen, and flounder toward his or her end goal,
often getting sidetracked or derailed from the main mission. Those with
a Locomotive chart shape know where they want to go, but seem to
inadvertently go on many tangents, taking the long, scenic route to the
destination rather than the shortest point between A and B.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image34.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

The Locomotive Chart Shape

Locomotive charts will also have a lead planet. The lead planet is the
first planet in line in the series of planets that occupy the two-thirds
of the chart. Going in order of the houses, House 1, House 2, House 3,
4, 5, 6, and so on, locate the first house that the first planet of the
Locomotive starts at. That first planet is the lead planet. In the first
Locomotive diagram of this section, the lead planet begins in House 1.
In the preceding Locomotive diagram above this paragraph, the lead
planet begins in House 11. Note that the lead planet is not the planet
in House 6 because that is not where the Locomotive shape begins, but
rather that is where the Locomotive shape ends. Beginning the assessment
at House 1, when you go around the wheel, the first planet that begins
the Locomotive shape is in House 11. Thus, that planet in House 11 is
considered the chart’s lead planet.

**The Seesaw**

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image35.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

A Seesaw Between Houses 1, 2, 3 and Houses 7, 8, 9

The Seesaw chart shape features two concentrated congregations of
celestial bodies that are completely separated from one another, and yet
coexisting, often featuring one or more stellium. (A stellium is a
congregation of four major planets or more in a single house and sign.)
The Seesaw chart features planets that seem to be grouped at two
opposing ends of the chart. Typically, the grouping occupies three
houses on each polar end. Just as the imagery might suggest, the Seesaw
chart pattern denotes one who will often feel pulled in two opposite
directions at the same time, creating stasis, a sense of stalemate, and
indecision.

The Seesaw chart reveals one of the harder life paths to walk. Nothing
worth having comes easy, seems to be the mantra here. Most people are
born with a single life purpose or one higher calling, as indicative in
the prevalence of the other chart shapes. The Seesaw chart, in contrast,
reveals two paths. Think of the Seesaw chart as the story of Buddha’s
fate as it was revealed to his father when Siddhartha (later to become
the Buddha) was born. A soothsayer told Siddhartha’s father that his son
had two possible life paths before him—he would either become a great
king and military leader or he would become a prophet and spiritual
teacher.

The native’s path, when the chart shape is the Seesaw, is marked for you
at birth as undetermined, though it can go in either one of two
directions. The Seesaw chart shows that part of the native’s path *is*
to *choose* a path. Yet it is not an easy choice, which is why this
chart pattern denotes one of the harder life paths. Both directions pull
at the native with equal fervor and interest. The native will feel
deeply attached, bound, and beholden to both directions. No matter which
the individual chooses, it will involve a difficult, painful sacrifice
and ensuing losses before the gains of your choice are earned.

**The Splash**

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image36.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

Astrological Chart Featuring the Splash

The Splash is considered a rare chart configuration. It expresses a
distribution of planets that are fairly yet regularly scattered around
the zodiac, reminiscent of organized chaos. You’re going to find
alternating houses with planets and empty houses in a relatively even
progression around the wheel. At first glance, there could be confusion
between the Splash chart and the Unclassified chart, which will be
covered later in this section. However, the clear distinction between a
Splash and an Unclassified is the even-handedness of the chaos. Again,
there will be a sense of “organized chaos” to the Splash chart, where
the planets are scattered, and yet in total, create a harmonious, steady
balance within the chart. Oftentimes an indicator of a Splash chart will
be an evenly distributed formation of empty houses around the chart,
that resemble three feet of a cauldron. However, without that indicator,
a chart could still potentially be a Splash.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image37.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

Astrological Chart Featuring the Splash

A Splash chart shows resilience. The native is a survivor, someone who
always land on his or her feet. And the native is also the
quintessential chameleon and a jack of all trades. Such an individual
knows a little bit about everything. However, when your specialty is
that you don’t have just one specialty, it becomes quite difficult to
define for yourself what your higher calling is. Those with a Splash
chart find it difficult to identify their life purpose.

When reading an astrological chart for an inquiry and the chart’s
overall shape is a Splash, the matter at hand is likely to resemble
organized chaos. Also, an eclectic, diverse combination of skills and
attributes will be the critical key to success. When the chart shape is
the Splash, it will be the jack of all trades who prevails.

**The Splay (Bucket, Sling)**

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image38.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

A Splay Chart with a Trine to the Independent Planet

A Splay chart is when the majority of planets seem to be positioned in
one concentrated part of the zodiac, except for a single, isolated
independent planet off on the opposite side of the chart. That isolated
independent planet off on the opposite side typically forms a trine with
one of the planets in the concentrated grouping. Such a trine would be
one of the prominent features in the chart worth noting, because the two
planets represent critical gifts, blessings, and keys to success
revealed to you by the Divine. However, not all Splay charts will have
that trine. The main feature of note that defines the Splay chart is
that single, isolated, and independent planet set apart and often at the
opposite end of the grouping of planets. You may hear chart shape names
such as the Bucket or the Sling. Both the Bucket and the Sling are
variations of the Splay chart.

If a chart forms the Splay, then you will want to pay close attention to
the independent planet. In the above diagram of a Splay chart, the
independent planet is domiciled in House 9. Analysis of that particular
planet will be critical in a chart reading for that native or for the
inquiry at hand.

An Unclassified Chart Shape

Not every chart will form a shape that has been characterized by Dr.
Jones. When a chart does not seem to fall within the parameters of any
of the six chart shapes noted, that chart is deemed Unclassified.
Unclassified charts are rare. An Unclassified chart is one with no clear
shape to speak of and an unequal scatter of planets.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image40.jpg" style="width:2.52196in;height:2.5in" />

An Unclassified Chart Shape

An Unclassified chart indicates a wild card. The native is one with an
undetermined path. This means that when we talk about this individual’s
soul purpose, life path, or destiny, there is no pre-fixed, designated
mission. The Unclassified chart reveals the self-determined path. When
the chart is Unclassified, it is worth revisiting both the native’s
personal sensitive points, especially the Arabic Parts, or Hermetic
Lots, specifically the Lot of Fortune and Lot of Spirit, which will be
covered in brief later on in this course. The personal sensitive points
in an Unclassified chart will prove to be the best indicators of success
and achievement for the native.

## Angular Aspects

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image42.png"
style="width:0.66279in;height:0.66279in" />

### Conjunction

A conjunction is formed when two celestial bodies are in close proximity
with one another, juxtaposed. The closeness in degree means the two
bodies are in effect conjoined. Some astrologers will define a
conjunction as two planets within 0° to 5° of one another; others say
it’s a conjunction so long as they are within a 10° proximity; still
other say the 10° proximity is correct, only if the two celestial bodies
are under the same decan ruler. Good practice would be to read a
conjunction when two celestial bodies are within 10° of each other.

Conjunctions create a bond between the two celestial bodies. They rise
together and fall together. They support one another to create success
but also cause failure in the native’s life path, especially in the area
of life corresponding to the house that the conjunction is in. Either
way, a conjunction is significant and worth paying attention to.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image43.png" style="width:0.66in;height:0.66in" />

### Opposition

An opposition is considered a hard aspect, where two planets are at a
direct 180° from one another, and therefore in the chart appear to be
facing off against one another. Hard aspects are said to present
challenges and difficulties in a native’s life path.

Often in a natal chart, oppositions represent forks, or choices that you
have to make, choosing the path that one celestial body and its
corresponding house represents, or the other. Oppositions in transits
astrology, where a crucial planet on a given day is in a 180° opposition
to a crucial planet in the natal chart, means a lot of energy is being
pulled out of and away from core objectives, so less resources are
availed to the core objectives expressed by the natal chart.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image44.png" style="width:0.66in;height:0.66in" />

### Trine

A trine is considered a soft aspect, where two planets are at a 120°
angle from one another. Soft aspects are considered harmonious and
supportive. Generally speaking, a trine brings blessings. When a planet
in a house is in trine with another planet, that other planet takes on
its most positive qualities and blesses the planet that it is in trine
with, bringing fortune and opportunities to the corresponding house, or
area of life.

Trines are indicators of innate talents that a native would possess and
expresses how other factors in the native’s life support and nurture
that talent.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image45.png" style="width:0.75003in;height:0.66in" />

### Sextile

A sextile is considered a soft aspect, where two planets are at a 60°
angle from one another. Sextiles reveal secondary blessings in a
native’s life. They indicate two areas of life as represented by the two
houses of the planets forming the sextile as compatible and supportive
of one another.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image46.png" style="width:0.66in;height:0.66in" />

### Square

A square is considered a hard aspect, where two planets are at a 90°
angle from one another. Squares create obstacles and challenges. It
shows that the two areas of life represented by the two houses of the
planets forming the square are in tension. These two areas of life as
they play out in the native’s life aren’t always agreeable with each
other, as indicated by the square.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image47.png" style="width:0.66in;height:0.66in" />

### Semisquare

A semisquare is formed when two planets are at a 45° angle from one
another. Semisquares are considered hard aspects, albeit minor ones.
They can reveal potential sources of conflict or tension in a native’s
life path. I think of the semisquare as a baby square. It’s got the same
energy and essential meaning as a square, but reduced, and with less
effect and influence than an actual square.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image48.png" style="width:0.66in;height:0.66in" />

### Sesquisquare

A sesquisquare is formed when two planets are at a 135° angle from one
another. Sesquisquares are hard aspects, but like the semisquare, are
minor hard aspects. They can indicate areas of minor soul fragmentation
or karmic dissonance, though areas that have been somewhat healed and
thus scarred over. In past life astrology, sesquisquares show areas that
were deeply troublesome in a past life, but are no longer troublesome in
this lifetime, though very minor concerns may still be present. In
divination, sesquisquares can reveal scars and shed light on past
influences, which have scarred over, that may affect the matter at hand.

A sesquisquare is like a visible scar, denoting soul fragmentation. The
planets will shed light on how that scar was formed.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image49.png" style="width:0.85161in;height:0.66in" />

### Quincunx

A quincunx (also referred to as an inconjunct) is formed when two
planets are at a 150° angle from one another. Whether a quincunx is
considered a hard or soft aspect will depend on the astrologer. I would
note that it varies on a case by case basis, determined by the planets
that the quincunx is formed between and their house placements.
Generally, the quincunx indicates where willpower and a native’s free
will must be channeled so that the higher purpose, as portended by the
midheaven sign, can be actualized. There can be an undertone of destiny
portended when we talk about quincunxes.

## Aspect Patterns

### The Stellium

In astrology, a stellium is a congregation of four or more major planets
all in one house. If you read under a Traditional Astrology approach,
where “major planets” are just the Sacred Seven, then you only observe
stelliums between the sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn. If you read under a Modern Astrology approach, then you would
observe the modern ten, or the sun, moon Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Today, given what astronomers have
learned about Pluto and Chiron, if you include Pluto, then you would
also include Chiron in the consideration. Since Juno and Ceres are
equally compelling dwarf planets, they, too, would be considered in
Modern Astrology now.

Such a cluster of celestial bodies in a single house drums up a great
deal of potent, obsessive energy in the area of life that the house
governs. Stelliums in a birth chart are significant, because the
astrological house that the stellium is in will pinpoint the area of
life that the native will want to focus on in this lifetime. It
indicates where there are knots of karma that needs resolving. Stelliums
under a particular zodiac sign means the qualities of that zodiac sign
are going to be more prominent in the native.

A stellium by its presence creates an opposition, but is much more
potent and nuanced than a mere opposition (one of the angular aspects
covered earlier). An opposition represents a choice being offered. What
the stellium represents is an obsessive, potent, self-creative but also
possibly self-destructive path while the other, the house and the
planets in that house at 180° to the stellium represent the other path,
the more stable, secure, path, the path that represents moderation. One
choice isn’t better than the other, and it will be up to a native to
choose which path, the self-creative possibly self-destructive path that
will take him or her to the brink of obsession, or the opposite to it,
the path of moderation.

Also, a stellium is a sign of potency and power. Where the stellium is
located will indicate where you wield the greatest pool of power. While
that sounds positive, it can be positive or negative. Here’s how I like
to think of a stellium: it’s like being born tall and gangly so that as
a child, you feel awkward about towering over all your peers. Thus, you
try to “hide” your tallness by crouching and slouching, only one day,
you finally realize that the awkward abnormality is an incredible gift,
and you get discovered by a scout, then go on to become an international
supermodel where your gangly height becomes your greatest personal
asset. That’s stellium power.

**Interpreting Stelliums**

- Revelation of destiny

- Events that will arise in a particular area of life (noting the
  astrological house of the stellium) that will have the most impact

- Obsession-compulsion

**SIGN of the Stellium**: Characteristics and traits that will be most
prevalent. *However*, if there is a strong opposition to that stellium,
then the oppositional force detracts from the stellium. *E.g.,* the
Seesaw chart pattern.

**HOUSE of Stellium**: Area of life where the stellium will have the
most impact. Of all facets of life, the astrological house containing
the stellium will be the one that a native focuses most of his or her
life path, energies, and resources on.

Be mindful of whether the stellium is comprised of personal planets
(sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, or Mars), social planets (Jupiter and
Saturn), or the slower moving transpersonal planets (Uranus, Neptune,
and Pluto). A dominance of personal planets, especially if the stellium
includes the sun or moon sign, will have a profound, perhaps to a
certain extent even inevitable impact on a native or in divination, on
the situation at hand. A stellium consisting of the slower moving
transpersonal planets is still significant, but there is a chance it can
have less of an impact on the native.

### Grand Trines

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image50.jpeg"
style="width:1.21221in;height:1.21918in" />

A grand trine is when there are three trines, or three aspects of 120°
angles between planets or celestial bodies in a chart that form a grand
trine connecting all the signs of a single element. Grand trines are
indicators of certain professional talents. The grand trines are
characterized by their element.

**The Grand Fire Trine**

A grand Fire trine connects the Fire signs, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius,
by 120° angles, which shows someone innovative, someone who will
accomplish a groundbreaking achievement, or one who pursues new,
creative endeavors. A grand Fire trine can point the way to a great
leader, an individualist, or a trailblazer. Here is someone who will
never be satisfied with just the status quo, and seeks advancement. The
planets or celestial bodies connected by the grand Fire trine will point
the way to the nature of such professional accomplishment.

Those with grand Fire trines in their chart are intensely creative, and
can manifest as writing talent. It’s also a “celebrity” sign, and can be
found in the charts of many public figures and Hollywood stars. In
divination, a grand Fire trine will emphasize the qualities of the Fire
triplicity. A grand Fire trine forms the Trinity of Life in a chart,
which bodes well for cutting edge innovation, creativity, individualism,
leadership, advancement, or career ambitions that correspond with the
Fire signs.

When there are trines connecting the Fire houses, or houses 1, 5, and 9,
such an aspect pattern is also read as a grand Fire trine.

**Grand Earth Trine**

A grand Earth trine connects the Earth signs, Capricorn, Taurus, and
Virgo and will reveal a native who is practical, diligent, a workaholic,
and someone who will become impressively resourceful and achieve wealth,
abundance, or prosperity from his or her investments. A grand Earth
trine produces smart, enterprising sensibilities. This trine often
signifies business, commercial, or financial success, success related to
commerce, assets, property, or investments. The planets or celestial
bodies connected by the grand Earth trine will point the way to the
nature of such professional accomplishment.

A grand Earth trine brings high intellect, a keen sense of logic and
reasoning skills, and a strong work ethic. There is an earthy, gritty,
yet sensual charm that most women with a grand Earth trine exude. The
grand Earth trine in a male chart brings a centered groundedness.

In divination, a grand Earth trine will emphasize the qualities of the
Earth triplicity. A grand Earth trine forms the Trinity of Wealth in a
chart, which bodes well for business matters, stability, longevity, and
staying power. It can also highlight good omens relating to Earth career
paths or attributes of the Earth triplicity.

**Grand Air Trine**

A grand Air trine connects the Air signs, Libra, Aquarius, and Gemini by
120° angles, which shows someone intellectual, scholarly, with
impressively strong verbal and communication skills. Here is someone who
will achieve great success and accomplish much in writing, publishing,
academia, teaching, politics, marketing, public relations, computers,
high-technology, or one of the STEM (science, technology, engineering,
and math) fields. The planets or celestial bodies connected by the grand
Air trine will point to the nature of such professional accomplishment.

You may find many writers, public speakers, politicians, social
activists, and media commentators with a grand Air trine. In divination,
a grand Air trine will emphasize the qualities of the Air triplicity. A
grand Air trine forms the Trinity of Concepts and Relationships in a
chart, which bodes well for communications, social constructions, legal
matters, writing and publishing, academia, teaching, marketing, or
public relations, or career ambitions that correspond with the Air
signs. When there are trines connecting the Air houses, or houses 3, 7,
and 11, such an aspect pattern is also read as a grand Air trine.

**Grand Water Trine**

A grand Water trine connects the Water signs, Cancer, Scorpio, and
Pisces by 120° angles, which shows someone who is highly intuitive,
spiritual, expressive of emotions and the unseen. Here is someone who
can achieve great public acclaim and success in the intuitive arts, the
sacred arts, counseling, pastoral work, holistic health, health,
healing, medicine, or some endeavor that is deeply humanitarian in
nature, serving the greater public good.

Those with grand Water trines are also said to be more intuitive, more
sensitive to the unseen metaphysical energies of the universe, and thus
often exhibit clairvoyant, psychic, intuitive, or empathic abilities. In
general, those with grand Water trines are deeply compassionate,
benevolent, and seek to improve the state of humanity. The planets or
celestial bodies connected by the grand Water trine will point to the
nature of such professional accomplishment.

There is a wistfulness to those with a grand Water trine. When there is
a grand Water trine in your birth chart, you’re a dreamer who wants to
change the world, maybe even try to save the world. You may even suffer
a bit from a hero complex, going out of your way to help those who don’t
really want to be helped. You don’t give up on people or causes. You
believe you can and will make a difference, if you only try hard enough.

In divination, a grand Water trine will emphasize the qualities of the
Water triplicity. A grand Water trine forms the Psychic Trinity in a
chart, which bodes well for emotional expression, creativity, spiritual
cultivation, love, romance, interpersonal relationships, or career
ambitions that correspond with the Water signs. When there are trines
connecting the Water houses, or houses 4, 8, and 12, such an aspect
pattern is also read as a grand Water trine

### Grand Crosses

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image51.jpeg"
style="width:2.04081in;height:2.05254in" />

A rather uncommon aspect pattern to be found in a chart is the grand
cross. A grand cross is formed by six major angular aspects—four squares
and two oppositions. As both squares and oppositions are considered hard
aspects, a grand cross amplifies the challenging qualities of the signs
and celestial bodies they link. However, it is a sign of the hero’s
journey. If a native can overcome the challenges presented to him or
her, then a grand cross prognosticates high echelons of success and
achievement. The two oppositions forming the cross will point into one
of the three modalities. That modality defines the implications of the
grand cross.

**Grand Cardinal Cross**

When the two oppositions point into the four Cardinal signs, the
astrological chart exhibits a grand Cardinal cross. That means the four
corners of a native’s Grand Cross are anchored in the signs Aries,
Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. The Cardinal signs represent initiations,
enterprise, and a pioneering spirit. They are leaders and innovators. A
grand Cardinal cross is one who must overcome creative blocks and
difficulties to achieve notability in a manner prognosticated by the
four celestial bodies linked by the grand cross.

**Grand Fixed Cross**

When two oppositions point into the four Fixed signs, a chart exhibits
the grand Fixed cross. That means the four corners of the Grand Cross
are anchored in the signs Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius, and Taurus. The Fixed
signs represent follow-through, diligence, and the synergy of ideas and
the implementation of those ideas. Cardinal signs are driven, ambitious,
with a warrior spirit. A grand Fixed cross is one who must overcome
challenges relating to completion of endeavors to achieve notability in
a manner prognosticated by the four celestial bodies linked by the grand
cross.

**Grand Mutable Cross**

When the two oppositions point into the four Mutable signs, a chart
exhibits a grand Mutable cross. That means the four corners of the Grand
Cross are anchored in the signs Sagittarius, Pisces, Gemini, and Virgo.
The Mutable signs represent adaptability, transformation, and changes.
Mutable signs are the masters of personal and social expression. They
communicate. They transmute. A grand Mutable cross is one who must
overcome challenges relating to transformation and change to achieve
notability in a manner prognosticated by the four celestial bodies
linked by the grand cross.

## The Yod (or Hand of God)

Yod is the tenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet and the most common
letter in the Torah. When God speaks directly to an individual for a
greater purpose, he inscribes it with His finger. Note Exodus 31:18,
“And He gave unto Moses, when He had made an end of communing with him
upon Mount Sinai, two tablets of testimony, tablets of stone, written
with the finger of God,” or in the Book of Daniel, when Belshazzar sees
the writing from the hand of God on a wall, inscribing words in Aramaic
that prophesy the fall of Babylon. In Revelations when God spoke to John
the apostle, the Hand of God appears.

Yod is the letter that appears among the people when one is visited by
God so that His work may be revealed on Earth—Jesus of Nazareth, Jacob,
Joseph, Israel… and Yod is referred to as the “Hand of God.” It also
describes a rare astrological phenomenon.

When one of the seven sacred planets is in sextile, or at a 60° angle
with another sacred planet, and that second sacred planet is at a
quincunx, or at a 150° angle, with a third, the three planets in effect
form an isosceles triangle, and such an astrological alignment is
referred to as a Yod, or the “Hand of God” touching the chart.

is obvious to others as our trademark or activity. It is what makes us

<p>House 2 is the house of your material foundation. This is the house
to read for wealth, prosperity, assets, liabilities, and personal
resources. We see into the native’s livelihood and possession here in
House 2 and also the native’s approach, outlook, and attitude toward
money or commerce. The second house tells of how money is earned, of
financial matters, and how we secure ourselves here on the earthly plane
so that who we are—the ascendant sign—can manifest.</p></th>

that define the person’s life and sense of purpose</p>
<p>The second house is concerned with how we respond to or field
whatever impulses or unique and personal qualities we manifest via our
first house. This is how we hold or "have" things (possessions, material
goods, money, and the like). The second house always refers to how we
secure ourselves, the kind of response we get from life and those around
us.</p>
<p>All money matters are governed by this house. Fortune, profits and
gains, power and resources, security, material achievements, jewelry,
shares, security, speech, eyes, vision, stocks and bonds, precious
stones, memory, education, tongue, nose teeth, chin and family are
governed by this house.</p></th>

explore and search for the limits of our life, whatever we are working
with at the moment. A very mental house, concerned with finding,
furthering, peering, and all manner of questioning. Traditionally rules
short journeys, siblings.</p>

done in the third house. Here we find or end our search, settle down,

<p>The sixth house has to do with salvaging and preserving what is good
and healthy in our experience. Here we separate the wheat from the
chaff. We begin to care for ourselves and our experience and thus
health, nutrition. The idea here is that we are able to analyze our
experience and have thoughts about what is pure and what is not.</p>

<p>The sixth house is the house of everyday life. Here is where we see
what you might do for a living, your job, and the necessary duties
you’ve taken on in life. This is your daily work. Here we can read about
your social or work environment, the mundane, and your professional
lifestyle. The sixth house is also the house of health and body. Here we
can find information about physical health conditions and what impacts
your physical body.</p>
<p>In traditional Hellenistic astrology, the sixth house was the house
of servitude. Here we see how you serve your society or community. This
is the role you play toward a greater social good. This is your social
contribution. The sixth house tells us what you do, your livelihood.
(Note that what motivates you toward that livelihood was found in the
fifth house, the house of your motivations and inner desires.)</p></th>

<p>WATER HOUSE (Part of the “Psychic Trinity” 4-8-12) – Emotion and
Soul</p>
<p>The eighth house, traditionally the house of death, is concerned with
getting rid of excess parts of ourselves that we see we no longer need.
Thus this house also covers initiation and any activities where we are
transforming toward a more integral position, getting to the heart of
things. The no-nonsense quality of the eighth house makes it good for
business ventures since here we are stripping away the dross to reveal
the truth or essence of the subject.</p>
<p>Longevity and span of life, inheritance, legacy, wills, insurance,
pension, gratuity, accidents, fire or suicide, misery, misfortune,
sorrow, strife, worries, disgrace, delay, dejection, disappointment,
loss, obstruction, theft and robbery are represented by this
house.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Stability, Tradition, Values</strong></p>

<p>House 8 at the hour of birth denotes potential phases of
transformations, crisis, and areas of waste in our lives that we would
do well to pay attention to and thus prepare for. House 12 denotes
awakenings, epiphanies, and on the other hand, possible losses and
challenges we face.</p>
<p>The eighth house is the house of sex, money, transformations, death,
and rebirth. The eighth house can indicate issues relating to personal
sexuality or sexual identity. It can also indicate money management, and
our relationship with commodities, assets, and currency. It is the
“death and taxes” house, as issues relating to financial relationships
with the government or society can be found here, along with
inheritances, estates, and legacies.</p>
<p>The eighth house is the house of acquired power. It can reveal how we
achieve power and the nature of power we gain in our present lives. As
the house of death, per traditional Hellenistic astrology, it was said
to be able to denote one’s longevity and life span.</p></th>

<p>The ninth house covers long journeys and religion (the longest
journey of all). Here is what remains of the purification that takes
place in the eighth house -- the seed, or essence, of an entire cycle of
experience. Religion comes from a Latin word that means to bind back,
and thus refers to all things that last or endure, such as the truth.

belong here.</p>

<p>The ninth house is the house of expansion. In traditional Hellenistic
astrology, it was the house of God. As phrased in the 1828 <em>A Manual
of Astrology (or the Book of the Stars)</em> by Raphael, the ninth house
is the house of “religion, science, learning, books, writing, voyages,
and distant travels.” That means we read the ninth house for your
personal spirituality, how you connect to higher consciousness, Spirit,
religion, faith, and matters relating to spirituality. The ninth house
reveals our spiritual journey and Path to Wisdom. It can also indicate
how we connect to the Akashic Records.</p></th>

<p>The 11th house has to do with putting our visions and dreams to work.
We have been on the mountain and had a vision (10th house). Here we take
our vows never to forget what we have seen and to work hard to make
these dreams into reality. Thus this house has always been connected
with altruistic and humanitarian goals and trying to set them in motion.
It is the house of friends and community, because when we are powered by
a real insight or vision we share with all -- irrespective of
differences.</p>

<p>The eleventh house is the house of community, how we relate to the
social groups that we are members of. This can indicate our friends,
social networks, alliances, and other supportive influences in our
lives. The eleventh house also shows the ways we are involved with the
collective, our sense of humanitarianism, and what we seek to contribute
to our world at large.</p>
<p>House 11 is a visionary house. It tells us how we implement our
visions in a way that impacts the society that we are a member of. This
house will express our sense of altruism. As part of that Divine Plan
mapped out for us at the moment of our birth, House 11 reveals our
social responsibility. It is what we are meant to contribute.</p></th>

limits or confines us.</p>
<p>It is also a karmic house, and so reveals the shadow self, what we
are not proud of, what we try to conceal about ourselves, or what we are
often afraid to confront. On the positive side, the twelfth house will
reveal secret talents and gifts we have locked away inside of ourselves,
which we may not fully develop in our chosen life paths. The twelfth
house reveals to you secrets about yourself you may not be conscious or
aware of, but intuitively you know you possess.</p></th>

## Sun: External Self

Generally when you’re talking about your horoscope sign, you mean your
sun sign, which is what you look up in the local paper or glossy
magazines. Over the course of one calendar year, from a geocentric point
of view, the sun appears to travel in an ecliptic around the earth and
in that travel, go through the twelve zodiac signs. Your sun sign is the
zodiac sign that the sun is in along that geocentric ecliptic on the day
of your birth. The sun sign offers insight into the external self, your
ego, and your general aspirations, but it is not truly who you are. It
may represent strong outside influences on the life trajectory you take,
the character of your will, but the ascendant sign is what will truly
tell us about you. When considering the influences of your biological
father on your nature, we will look to the sun sign. The sun sign
changes every 22-23 days, and so we often say that the month of your
birth is the primary indicator of the personality you develop and the
formation of your sense of self. The sun is your willpower, and so the
aspects to the sun in your natal chart show us where you distribute your
willpower to and how you might execute that will.

## Moon: Internal Self

On its orbit around the earth, the moon will travel through all twelve
signs in approximately 28 days. Your moon sign is which zodiac sign the
moon was in on the day of your birth during its routine 28-day orbit. I
read the moon sign for past life astrology, but it also is indicative of
skills and areas you will develop in this lifetime to best achieve your
life purpose. The sun sign is central to who you strive to be and how
you are perceived, whereas the ascendant sign is who you really are at
your core. The moon sign offers a sense of what you’re capable of being
very good at, though it takes conscious work on your part to manifest
these latent talents into your physical world. When considering the
influences of your biological mother on your nature, we will look to the
moon sign. The moon changes signs every 2 or so days, which is why two
people with the same sun sign can still be so different. The moon sign
is what makes the difference.

## Ascendant Sign

The earth rotates eastward, and so from the geocentric perspective, the
sun rises from the east and sets in the west. The ascendant sign is an
angle, the degree in a zodiac sign that was just at the eastern horizon,
rising up at the precise moment of your birth, as viewed from the
location of your birth. Thus, this sign is referred to as the ascendant
or rising sign. It is the sign rising in the East at the moment of your
birth from the location of your birth. The ascendant sign symbolizes the
awakening or rising of your current consciousness.

The ascendant sign is how you best identify. It is you, your identity.
It offers insight into the most immediate impact on the structure of
your life. It may influence your physical appearance, your complexion,
body, and overall health. Your personality will be formed substantially
by your ascendant sign, not your sun sign (the more commonly understood
horoscope sign). The ascendant sign changes every few hours, and so it
is the most accurate in determining who you really are, more accurate
than your sun sign.

Your sun sign spoke to what is essentially your month of birth, which
conveys a sense of general archetypal personas and the major influences
over your external character. Your moon sign spoke to your day of birth
within that month of birth, which expresses your subconscious, the
cellular or genetic memory encoded within you that is latent, and where
you come from.

Your ascendant sign (also referred to as the rising sign) speaks to your
hour of birth. Of your three birth signs per the trinity of natal
astrology, your ascendant sign will be the most accurate indicator of
who you are, or the core and spirit of you. Just as that ascendant sign
is rising in the east, your waking consciousness within the newborn you
will be synchronistic with the implications and influences of that
rising sign.

Your ascendant sign has the most immediate impact on the structure of
your life. It tells of your physical statue, complexion, personality,
temperament, and how others see you (though to get a sense of your
personality and persona, you will want to read the ascendant sign in
conjunction with the co ascendant and polar ascendant signs, which we
will get to later in this monograph).

## Lunar Nodes

From a geocentric perspective, the sun appears to orbit the earth, and
that was what medieval astrologers believed. That orbit of the sun seems
to be along an invisible yet distinct band, going through the twelve
zodiac signs in a particular order, which is referred to as the
ecliptic.

The moon, likewise, has an orbit around the earth, though the moon’s
orbit around the earth is inclined at about 5° from that ecliptic. The
invisible intersection between these two orbits, the moon and the sun’s
ecliptic, are the lunar nodes—one intersection appears in the north,
called the northern node, and one intersection appears in the south,
called the southern node.

These nodes, or invisible intersections between the path of the moon’s
orbit and the apparent path of the sun (geocentrically) then move
through the zodiac signs. Astrologers hold that these lunar nodes as
they are positioned at the moment of your birth contain residual
information about your karma and facets of your subconscious or even
unconscious that you are not likely to be consciously aware of.

In Chinese astrology, the lunar nodes are expressed as a celestial
dragon. The northern node is the dragon’s head and the southern node is
the dragon’s tail. The dragon’s head points toward your destiny, where
you are headed, what will fulfill you, the purpose you are to manifest.
Thus, the northern node is an important feature in a natal chart to
examine when considering life purpose, destiny, and the trajectory of
your karma into the future. The southern node, or the dragon’s tail,
reveals the past. It’s a critical point of analysis in past life
astrology. It reveals what is latent in the subconscious, especially
what has been embedded there from our childhood. For most astrology
software programs, the southern node is not shown in default settings,
but that’s okay. Look for the northern node, and the southern node will
be at a 180° angle from the northern node.

### North Node

The northern node represents karmic gifts, the innate blessings we have
that, if we wield our free will in a way that makes the most of these
gifts, will bring us great success in life. To put it simplistically,
the northern node reveals our karmic rewards, though some of us have not
yet been able to consciously identify what those blessings are. So a
northern node analysis helps you to identify them. I also read the north
node as blessings or traits that recur within us, passed on from one
lifetime to the next. In other words, the blessings or traits designated
by your north node for your present life as \<\*\*\*NAME\*\*\*\> were
also qualities you possessed and developed in your past life
incarnation.

I also believe that the Divine plants a clue for us in the northern
node. The northern node is a celestial sign post that points us in the
direction we ought to go in if we wish to go toward the Light, toward
closeness with Divinity. In other words, taking cues from the northern
node will take you toward a strong sense of personal fulfillment,
achievement, and success. Follow the Light, and so pay attention to your
northern node.

| Leo North Node            | Aquarius North Node    |
| Virgo North Node          | Pisces North Node      |

### South Node

The southern node is always in relation to the northern node, at a
direct 180° or in opposition with the northern node. This is
metaphysically significant. In shadow working through natal astrology,
the first point of analysis for me would be the southern lunar node.

I believe that when we are born, we aren’t born innocent, at least not
exactly. I liken my personal gnosis on the subject to the Christian
belief of original sin, except there is a twist to my view. You are born
carrying the weight of your past karma. Those you have taken from in
your past you now owe; those who have taken from you will now pay
up—karmically speaking, that is. There are scores to settle in this
lifetime attributed to what took place before our current consciousness.
While we ourselves may have forgotten the nature of these scores, the
universe has not. Residual data about those karmic scores can be found
in the southern node.

In more mundane terms, the southern node is your shadow self. It can
indicate what we have repressed in the subconscious, and by addressing
these aspects, we are able to move in a progressive direction toward the
light. The southern node marks the holes we feel in our lives but can’t
seem to put a name or memory to. The southern node can reveal our
insecurities. By naming and confronting our own insecurities, we can
finally move past them.

# Asteroids

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image81.jpg"
style="width:5.91718in;height:8.9726in" />

Alphabetical Listing of Known Asteroids

**Aesculapia 1027**

Aesculapia relates to health, healing, and is often associated with
healers, physicians, or those in the health and medical professions.
Thus, Aesculapia rising in a birth chart can indicate one with a destiny
to become a healer, medical doctor, or to serve in the health, nursing,
and healing professions.

**Amor 1221**

House and sign placement of Amor shows where the native is most
compassionate and where the native is more likely to demonstrate
unconditional love, mercy, and understanding. Amor rising in a natal
chart indicates a deeply compassionate soul, one who demonstrates deep
love, mercy, and understanding for others. If your chart bears Amor
rising, then there is a sweetly bodhisattva-like quality to you.

**Apollo 1862**

House and sign placement of Apollo shows where a native is most
creative. A strongly positioned Apollo indicates creative talent.
Weakened Apollo indicates one who does not actively exercise his or her
creative and intuitive abilities.

Apollo rising in a birth chart shows strong innate creative talent. When
you have Apollo rising in your chart, you’re likely to be born with
creative, artistic, or musical gifts. Also, the arts, humanities, and
classics are integral to your sense of personal identity. Artistic
expression goes to the core of who you are and who you want to be.

**Arachne 407**

Arachne relates to one’s social network. This shows how well-connected
you are. The house placement of Arachne shows the area of life where you
may have the most social connections, and can hint at how to tap into
that network to achieve your goals. Arachne in one of the masculine
signs—Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, or Aquarius—can amplify an
extroverted nature and bring social popularity, and who is more open and
revealing of personal experiences. Arachne in one of the feminine
signs—Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, or Pisces—can amplify
an introverted nature and one who likes to maintain a staunchly private
life, and who is more resistant to revealing personal details.

A rising Arachne can indicate one with a strong social network, who is
connected to many different types of people, high and low. If you have
Arachne rising, then your tribe is a diverse one. You are like an
intermediary, or a bridge that connects the different types of people
and you bring them together. One of your great strengths is to be such a
social ambassador.

**  
**

**Astraea 5**

Astraea is a point of consideration for shadow work or personal
psychological self-improvement. Astraea shows where we feel most
materially detached, where we are unable to let go of pain, and where
toxins can seep into our life paths and poison our experiences.
Astraea’s house placement shows a weaker area of our lives and sign
placement shows weakened character traits. Astraea points to an area of
soul fragmentation that requires active, conscious efforts toward
healing.

In Greek mythology, Astraea (or Astrea) was the celestial virgin goddess
of purity, innocence, and justice, who abandoned mankind when it fell
into wickedness and ascended up into the heavens to become the
constellation Virgo. As the legend goes, Astraea is prophesied to return
to earth and when she does, will usher in a golden age.

Astraea rising in a chart can indicate a renaissance man or woman. It
shows one who embodies the traits associated with the celestial goddess
Astraea. In astrology, the asteroid Astraea also relates to the shadow
self. Where Astraea is domiciled in a natal chart is the area of life
that native most needs to work on, with the shadow self is most deeply
embedded. With Astraea rising, much of your work with your shadow self
is about identity issues and self-love, loving who you are. Much of the
work with healing soul fragmentation for you involves self-love and
self-care.

**Atlantis 1198**

The house and sign placement of Atlantis brings much volatility and
insecurity in that area of life. That’s because Atlantic both
prognosticates extreme, extraordinary success, glory, and
accomplishment, but also prognosticates areas of disaster and harm.
Where Atlantis is in a chart will bring fleeting happiness (but also
fleeting loss) to that area of life. Zodiac sign placement of Atlantis
points to the personality traits that are most volatile in a native—you
shift back and forth between strong demonstration of these traits and
complete neglect of them.

Atlantis pushes the energies that were present to extreme ends. Thus,
Atlantis rising can create extreme traits in a personality. The asteroid
Atlantis prognosticates extreme, extraordinary success, glory, and
accomplishment, but also prognosticates areas of disaster and harm.
Atlantis rising means you tend to embody the very best and the very
worst of the qualities, traits, and personality characteristics
associated with your ascendant sign.

**  
**

**Bacchus 2063**

The house and sign placement of Bacchus can indicate areas of excess or
abuse. Bacchus relates to intoxication and addictions. House and sign
placement of Bacchus alerts us to where we must actively and
conscientiously choose the middle path, and be ever cognizant of our
behavior in that area of life or those character traits to ensure that
they remain balanced.

Bacchus rising in your chart can indicate issues relating to excess,
abuse, intoxication, or additions. It is a cautionary note that in life,
choose the middle path and always seek out temperance, rather than verge
toward any of the extremes.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image82.jpeg"
style="width:0.68481in;height:0.99901in" />

**Ceres 1**

Ceres is a dwarf planet, like Pluto. It has risen in popularity lately.
House placement of Ceres shows where you are more likely to have access
to needed or desired resources from your environment to achieve your
goals. Strong placement of Ceres can indicate community activism.

Ceres in House 4 or 5, or under Cancer or Leo indicate fertility, good
health, and a strong interest in nurturing home and hearth. Those with
Ceres in Cancer, Leo, House 4, or House 5 tend to have better stamina,
motivation, and never seem to run out of creative ideas. They possess a
heightened sense of imagination and forward-thinking vision.

Ceres in Virgo or House 6 can indicate an innate talent in cooking, or
greater knowledge when it comes to food and wine. However, Ceres here
can indicate fertility issues or health complications with regard to the
uterus or stomach.

Ceres expresses our connection to the world at large and how we utilize
the resources we have access to and whether we can utilize the resources
availed to us by fate or by fortune to make something of ourselves.
Ceres rising is considered a strong placed Ceres, and so it can suggest
one who has a more public face, who is interested in community activism,
who could become an activist or even a politician, someone working
toward public policy in a significant way. Ceres rising shows one with a
strong connection to earth consciousness, to the environment, to nature,
and who possesses innately a great power to harness natural forces.
Ceres rising can be an astrological sign of witchcraft or a nature-based
spiritual path, for instance.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image83.jpg" style="width:0.57in;height:1in" />

**Chiron 2060**

Chiron was covered earlier under Planets in the Houses and Signs. Chiron
points to deepest personal wounds, yet our greatest personal strengths
and where you possess healing powers. Chiron placement indicates areas
of overcompensation as a result of past wounds sustained in that
corresponding area of life.

**Circe 34**

Circe relates to magic, witchcraft, and supernatural or paranormal
controls. On a mundane level, it also shows where we are strongest in
our personal power, so where we are most adept at defeating our
adversaries.

Circe rising in a chart can indicate a person who has experienced
supernatural or paranormal phenomenon in his or her life. Those with
Circe in the sun sign or moon sign will also exhibit these qualities. A
strongly or prominently positioned Circe also shows one with enormously
strong personal power and control over the elements. Traditionally,
Circe is related to magic, witchcraft, and esotericism. These aspects
can be integral to a native’s sense of personal identity when we see
Circe in the ascendant house.

**Cupido 763**

Cupido relates to our connection to our ancestors and family. House and
sign placement can indicate the strength or weakness of that connection.
Cupido also relates to artistry and creativity. When we see one with
Cupido rising, the native is deeply bonded to his or her ancestors and
we see one who may possess a mediumship ability to connect with
ancestral lines. Cupido also relates to our creativity and imagination,
so one with Cupido rising is likely to be more intuitive, more artistic,
and have an expansive imagination and sense of vision. Likewise, those
with Cupido in their sun sign or moon sign will also exhibit these
qualities.

**  
**

**Demeter 1108**

House and sign placement of Demeter can indicate fertility. It shows
where one is most nurturing. Demeter also relates to mother and child
relations. House and sign placement of Demeter can reveal the nature of
your relationship to your mother or mother figure. Demeter relates to
the area of life where we bear the most caretaking responsibilities. It
also relates to our connection to nature.

A rising Demeter shows one who is a caretaker and nurturer. It reveals
deep karmic bonds between mother and child. When Demeter is in your
ascendant house, you’re one who is close to nature, animals, and may be
gifted with abundant fertility. A rising Demeter could also bring a
green thumb, or one blessed with the gift of gardening.

**Diana 78**

House and sign placement of Diana relates to the hunter spirit within
us. How does the hunter to prey dynamic manifest within us? House and
sign placement of Diana will indicate our assertiveness. Diana also
indicates our connection to nature and wild animals.

A rising Diana brings a strong will, a warrior-hunter spirit, and a deep
connection and compassion for feral or wild animals. A rising Diana
might indicate one who isn’t keenly interested in love, romance, or
being part of a relationship. Here is someone who would be perfectly
happy single, independent, and free.

**Eros 433**

Eros relates to joie de vivre. It shows one’s passion for life. House
and sign placement of Eros shows where you most enjoy yourself and where
you can find happiness. The house placement of Eros shows the area of
life that you’re most passionate about. Sign placement shows how that
passion manifests. For example, Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, House 4, House 8,
or House 12 Eros can indicate one whose passion is turned inward, toward
personal reflection, spiritual development, home and hearth, and one who
is more of a homebody. One’s passion is one’s family. Eros in a Fire
sign or Fire house can indicate a passion for achieving glory, an
ambitious, dauntless nature, and one who has a big appetite for enjoying
life’s great pleasures.

Those with Eros rising know how to enjoy life; these are individuals who
can see the lighter and light-hearted facets of life. We also see one
passionate about self-discovery and self-actualization.

Eros in a Fire or Air sign is in a position of empowerment, so this is
an indicator of one who actively pursues his or her dreams, who has a
dauntless nature, and who goes for what he or she wants without apology.
Eros in a Water or Earth sign shows passivity, a more introverted
nature, introspective, and whose passions are turned inward toward
personal reflection, self-development, and who does not need to achieve
by society’s materialistic standards to feel successful.

**Eurydike 75**

Eurydike relates to the social sphere and one’s ability to move or
influence social classes through emotional appeal. Eurydike relates to
how much charisma we possess and our emotional quotient. Those with
Eurydike rising in their birth charts are likely to be socially mobile
and may transition significantly between different social classes during
their life paths. Those with Eurydike rising also tend to be
charismatic. They conduct themselves well in social circles and possess
a high, healthy emotional quotient (EQ). Those with Eurydike rising have
a higher probability than most to assert social influence.

**Hebe 6**

In Greek mythology, Hebe was the daughter of Zeus and Hera, who served
as the cupbearer of ambrosia for the deities on Olympus. Ambrosia is the
nectar for immortality and longevity. Thus here there is a sense of one
who serves in the health, medical, healing, or wellness professions,
with ambrosia being the metaphor for the work you endeavor in.

Hebe relates to service. When Hebe is rising in the ascendant house, the
native will be one called to serve others. There is an inner calling
toward a path that can be expressed by the metaphor of dispensing
ambrosia. If Hebe is in your rising sign, sun sign, or moon sign, then
you are one who seeks to promote longevity and immortality in your own
way, through a form of divine service.

Broadly speaking, Hebe 6 can also relate to the service industries.

**Hera 103**

Hera brings great personal power and strength of will and character.
House correspondence shows the area of life in which we possess innate
power, great ability and competency, and better fortunes. Zodiac sign
placement of Hera shows the personal traits, persona, and character that
is most prominent in us, that others see, that others adjudicate us by,
and that are strongest in us. Sign placement for Hera shows character
traits that can be as strong in you as your sun, moon, or rising signs.
Hera relates to social justice, balance, partnerships, jealousy,
vengeance, and envy.

A rising Hera amplifies the ferocity and willfulness of a native. When
you bear a rising Hera in your birth chart, you have a fierce sense of
social justice, can exhibit severe vengefulness when you feel you or a
loved one has been wronged, and possess a strong, righteous sense of
morality. A rising Hera brings great personal power, strength of
character, and self-possession.

**  
**

**Hidalgo 944**

Hidalgo is social masculinity. Hidalgo in a Fire or Air house and in a
Fire or Air sign can indicate one who exhibits strong socially masculine
traits (irrespective of the gender you identify as), whereas Water or
Earth house and Water or Earth sign placement indicates suppressed
masculinity. Hidalgo relates to revolutions, social change,
righteousness, aggression, and patriarchy.

Hidalgo rising can indicate a life path that includes the theme of
confrontation with patriarchy. Hidalgo rising can also be an
astrological signifier of noble birth or noble lineage. However, whether
that is ancestral or read through past life astrology, or both, is not
entirely clear.

**Hopi 2938**

A strongly positioned Hopi can indicate interest in archeology,
sociology, or anthropology. It shows one with a strong interest in
culture and the history of civilizations. House and sign placement of
Hopi in a natal chart can also indicate an area of life where we tend to
feel more marginalized or misunderstood.

Hopi rising in a chart can bring compassion and a keen personal interest
for minority or marginalized cultures and heritages. Such a native with
Hopi rising may find yourself interested in exploring cultures and
religions of extinct civilizations, aborigine or tribal groups, and a
natural interest for archeology, sociology, or anthropology.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image84.jpeg" style="width:0.57923in;height:1in" />

**Hygeia 10**

Hygeia can indicate one’s physical health and vigor. Sign placement of
Hygeia can point to where there may be greater medical concerns. For
example, Hygeia in Cancer can indicate health concerns relating to the
chest area; Hygeia in Libra can indicate the kidneys or skin conditions;
Hygeia in Scorpio can indicate the reproductive organs.

Hygeia is about wellness, health, and the body. It is an asteroid that
astrologers interpret as relating to health, fitness, nutrition,
personal wellness, and in its essence, areas of life that merge mind,
body, and spirit. Sign placement of Hygeia can point to areas of the
physical body that may be of primary concern for you.

Hygeia is also related to physical activity with a spiritual nature, or
where mind, body, and spirit synthesize, such as in martial arts, tai
chi, reiki, or forms of holistic healing.

**  
**

**Icarus 1566**

Icarus relates to our impulses. The house and sign placement of Icarus
can indicate dangers, risks, or areas of life where a native tends to
run away from his or her problems. Icarus shows avoidance. Its placement
shows what you avoid, where you tend to run away rather than confront
difficult issues or obstacles. In the corresponding areas of life per
house and sign placement, Icarus shows that in the fight or flight
mechanism within, you tend to choose flight.

**Isis 42**

House and sign placement of Isis shows one’s affiliation with fraternal
organizations, a sense of affiliation with brotherhoods or sisterhoods,
or sibling relations. Isis also relates to magic and the ability to
control elements of nature. Isis also relates to the power of seduction
and influence. House placement of Isis can indicate where one wields the
most power of seduction and influence over others to get what you want.

Isis rising in a chart, as one appears in yours, can indicate possession
of the power of seduction and influence, of the ability to control the
natural elements or wield power over others. Isis also relates to
sibling relationships and fraternal organizations. It can indicate the
importance of sisterhood or brotherhood in your life and in the forging
of your personal identity.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image85.jpeg" style="width:0.83814in;height:1in" />

**Juno 3**

Where you will find your one true love, soul mate, Great Love, and that
one who completes you to make you whole. Whereas Venus is about sex,
attraction, and beauty, or who we have passionate chemistry with, Juno
is about stable, long-term relationships connected at the soul-level.
Juno points to your soul mate or one true love in this lifetime.

Juno rising in a birth chart shows that your personal identity and the
core of who you are is inextricably tied to your one Great Love, and
that marriage or civil union is deeply ingrained into your sense of
identity. Juno rising is the sign of connection with your soul mate and
bodes well for love and romance, though it can also indicate a personal
identity that is defined primarily through such love and romance.

**  
**

**Kassandra 114**

Kassandra relates to advice and counsel. It is an indication of wisdom
and knowledge. The house placement of Kassandra can indicate an area of
life where you can best serve as an advisor, counselor, or consultant.
Kassandra points to where you are most knowledgeable. Sign placement
shows how that knowledge and wisdom manifests in you. For example,
Kassandra in House 3 or Gemini can indicate great aptitude of knowledge
and abilities of counsel in writing, communication, pedagogy, or
literature. Kassandra in Aries can point to entrepreneurship. A tenth
house Kassandra or Kassandra in Capricorn can point to one would succeed
remarkably in a professional path of counseling or to serve an advisor
role.

Per Greek mythos, Kassandra was blessed with the gift of prophecy but
then cursed with the plight that no one would believe her prophecies.
Thus, her prophetic power was futile in avoiding disaster. She was
unable to help people avoid suffering because people would not listen to
her counsel. Kassandra foresaw the destruction of Troy, her homeland,
but she could not prevent the destruction because no one believed her
prophecy.

Likewise, those with Kassandra rising in their charts have a gift for
prophecy, but it may take some time for you to learn to trust yourself.
Kassandra rising is often an astrological indicator of a diviner or
oracle, or one who was a diviner or oracle in a previous lifetime.

**Lilith 1181**

Lilith 1181, the asteroid, which is different from black moon Lilith
covered earlier, also relates to the shadow self. More specifically,
Lilith relates to rebellion, suppressed energy, unconscious energy that
actively tries to become conscious, defiance, and subversive behavior
against patriarchy. The house Lilith resides in will reveal which area
of life for you bears the most potent amount of unconscious, volatile
energy. A prominently positioned Lilith can indicate one more prone to
subversive behavior or alternative culture, one who actively seeks to go
against the current of the mainstream. A weak positioning of Lilith can
indicate one who is more of a gentle spirit, who does not seek active
rebellion, subversive behavior, or defiance.

A rising Lilith, the asteroid, can indicate one more prone to subversive
behavior or alternative culture. Here is someone who actively seeks to
go against the current of the mainstream. Lilith in the ascendant house
is the sign of a strong dark side, which does not indicate anything
negative, but just the opposite—it shows depth of perception and
understanding of human nature. Take care parents, if your child bears a
rising Lilith in the chart—it can show a willful, fiercely independent
child with a rebellious nature. Yet this is a child who survives
anything and everything, and one who will grow up to become one who
commands remarkable personal power. A rising Lilith can reveal one who
seeks defiance against patriarchy.

**

**Minerva 93**

Minerva relates to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It
is the sign of calculations, economics, and public relations. House and
sign placement of Minerva can indicate aptitude in science or
mathematics.

Minerva rising can bring an innate or hidden talent with logical
reasoning, calculations, and analysis. There is a mathematical nature to
the way you think and process information. There could also be strengths
in public relations, marketing, and an understanding of social
economics. This is someone with a strong sense for sociology,
anthropology, and how to explain, through reason, matters that otherwise
seem inexplicable. A rising Minerva gives you an analytical
understanding of human nature.

**Nemesis 128**

Nemesis relates to our inner weaknesses. The house and sign placement of
Nemesis shows the area of life that can be your undoing. Nemesis relates
to bête noire. When people criticize you in matters or issues relating
to the house or sign placement of your Nemesis, you are most
hyper-sensitive and defensive. Nemesis is that inner sensitive point of
weakness where, when triggered, can bring out the darkest side of who
you are. When using natal astrology in shadow working, Nemesis 128 is
one of the main considerations. Nemesis can reveal where your inner
villain is, the characterization of your own worst enemy, and that part
of your inner self that seems to always fight against you and try to
obstruct your aspirations. To clear your path to success, clear the
obstructions that the house and sign of your Nemesis placement
represents.

Nemesis rising can bring difficulties and challenges to the internal
self. When one seeks to understand the shadow self through natal
asteroids, one of the main considerations is the house and sign
placement of Nemesis. With Nemesis rising, a native struggles against
the inner self. The villain that one with Nemesis rising battles in the
native’s journey is, the Self. Those with Nemesis rising obstruct
themselves from the path to success. They are their own worst enemy,
loudest and harshest critic, and it is your own inner self that seeks
the undoing of your outer self.

Nemesis rising can indicate one who embodies within you the divine power
of a dark goddess. We see one who believes strongly in justice and even
more than that, seeks immediate punishment and the issuing of judgment
against those who you believe have done wrong. If you have Nemesis
rising in your chart, then you come down hard on people when they have
done wrong. Likewise, you come down hard on yourself for your own
transgressions. You feel the weight of guilt like nobody else. You never
let go of your own mistakes and you let them fester into dark,
debilitating regrets.

Seeking forgiveness of the self and learning to make peace with your
imperfections can become the lifelong lesson of one with Nemesis rising.
These traits as listed are also going to come into play if you have
Nemesis in your sun sign or moon sign.

Those with Nemesis rising, Nemesis in the sun sign, or moon sign, may be
more prone to experiencing a psychological phenomenon called an
inferiority complex. There can be the tendency to suffer from a lack of
self-worth. One of your greater obstacles to overcome is your sense of
self-doubt and deep-seated insecurities. You feel you do not measure up
to societal standards and this bothers you, a lot.

Funny thing is the result of an inferiority complex is superiority:
those who suffer from an inferiority complex overcompensate by
over-achieving, a trait often found in those with Nemesis in the sun,
moon, or rising signs. You are likely to be a high achiever. Another
possible symptom of an inferiority complex is asocial behavior. The
inferiority complex, although psychological, is believed to be genetic,
and interestingly enough, is often revealed in our astrological birth
charts, as it is in yours.

**Niobe 71**

Niobe relates to pride and ego. Where Niobe is positioned in your chart
indicates areas of life where you must learn lessons of humility. House
and sign placement of Niobe indicates where you feel the most pride in
yourself, and likewise, indicates where you need to “check your ego” and
learn to be more modest about yourself.

Per Greek mythos, Niobe’s great vice was pride. She boasted of her
children, which incited the ire and indignation of the other gods and
goddesses. Her punishment was the killing of her children. Devastated,
Niobe retreated to solitude and turned to stone. The stone she was,
though, wept incessantly.

Thus, when we see Niobe rising in a birth chart, we see one who must
learn difficult lessons of humility. Niobe rising can be the sign of one
who experiences great pain and suffering in life, a difficult hero’s
journey. There can be difficulties when it comes to creation, where that
which you most value as your creations may meet difficult ends.

**Orpheus 3361**

Orpheus relates to personal loss. It also relates to contact with the
dead. Certain positioning of Orpheus can indicate mediumship. Orpheus
relates to grief and clairaudience. Thus, Orpheus rising can be a sign
of mediumship or the gift of clairaudience. Likewise, when Orpheus is in
the sun sign or moon sign.

Orpheus rising or Orpheus in the sun or moon signs can also indicate a
deep, karmic connection between you and the underworld, where that veil
between life and death is thin, as perceived by you. This can indicate
one who experiences significant personal loss through death, or one who
has contacted the dead before.

**Pallas 2**

Pallas relates to the cerebral nature, high intelligence, a native’s
relationship with his or her father, the art of war, strategic planning,
balance and restorative justice, great personal power, and the power of
survival. Pallas is related to Libra. The house that Pallas (also known
as Pallas Athena) occupies indicates the area of life that the native
will bear extraordinary gifts, innate talent, and personal power in,
often gifts and talent inherited from the father’s side of the family.
Generally, much insight can be gleaned about paternal influences and a
native’s father figure by reading Pallas. In certain houses—Houses 1, 5,
6, 8, or 12—Pallas can bring a weakened immune system, and so such a
native may be more prone to illness. House placement of Pallas can
indicate areas of life we are most like our fathers; sign placement of
Pallas indicates character traits we inherit from our fathers.

A rising Pallas brings a strategic nature and one who is more cerebral.
Pallas is linked to the sign Libra, and thus corresponds with balance,
harmony, creativity, the ability to spot patterns in chaos, diplomacy,
and good judgment. When Pallas is in the ascendant house, it can
indicate that your personality is more like your father than your
mother. A Pallas ascendant can also bring a weakened immune system, and
so such a native may be more prone to illness.

**Panacea 2878**

Panacea shows the area of life that brings you the most healing, where
you tend to find solutions. Panacea is about what always and
consistently cures you and reveal keys to how you can solve your
problems. Panacea in House 3 or Gemini, for instance, can indicate
solutions through siblings, writing abilities, communications, or
dialogue. Panacea in House 7 or Libra can indicate solutions through
marriage, partnerships, the law, or legal contracts.

Panacea rising is a strong omen of self-empowerment. One with Panacea
rising in the natal chart is one with intense, incredible personal power
and drive, which can be wielded toward great success and high
achievement. Panacea rising is one of the more auspicious asteroid
placements to have in a birth chart. It indicates humanitarian
motivations, a strong sense of obligation toward society and social
justice, and therefore a strong desire to innovate and create toward a
greater good. You seek to find solutions for a common good.

**  
**

**Pandora 55**

House and sign placement of Pandora indicate where we are often
misunderstood. Pandora reveals societal wrongdoing. It is about exposing
truths, bringing through a firebrand energy, incitement, and curiosity.
A strongly positioned Pandora, such as in the rising sign, can indicate
a rabble rouser. It brings strong energies of curiosity and adventure.

Pandora rising, and also Pandora in the sun sign or moon sign, is the
sign of one with strong curiosity for the unknown and a spiritual seeker
for greater truth or knowledge. With Pandora rising in your chart, you
might resonate with the mythos of Pandora. With Pandora rising in your
chart, there could be an innate or karmic narrative in your life of
accidentally or inadvertently causing harm to others. Pandora rising
might be an omen of one who hurts those closest to him or her.

**Persephone 339**

House and sign placement of Persephone indicate where we harbor a fear
of change, where we are afraid to take charge of our own life paths.
These are areas where you tend to feel helpless, but that feeling of
helplessness is only in our minds, a mirage we must learn to overcome
and not be afraid of.

Persephone rising in your birth chart can indicate one who is afraid of
change, who hesitates in taking charge of his or her own life path. You
may tend to find that circumstances happen to you rather than you
assertively going out to make things happen for yourself.

Persephone rising can reveal cycles of the same mistake being made
throughout the course of your life path, due to feeling helpless in the
face of the extenuating circumstances you find yourself in. One key
lesson to learn when you have Persephone rising in your chart is how to
be more creative and witty about getting yourself out of situations you
do not want to be in.

A key lesson in your life path when you have Persephone rising is how to
adopt a more cunning attitude. Rather than wait or allow things to
happen to you, be bold and take the initiative forward to confront what
may come and stop it or seize what it is you want and reel it in. These
attributes for Persephone rising also apply to those with Persephone in
the sun sign or moon sign.

**  
**

**Phaethon 3200**

Phaethon relates to travel. House and sign placement of Phaethon can
indicate how frequently we travel or utilize transportation and motor
vehicles. It can indicate whether one tends to be stationary and
homebound or whether one is a peripatetic, a restless traveler, and one
who seeks multicultural experiences.

Phaethon rising in a chart can indicate restlessness, and one who makes
a dramatic geographic relocation or move in the course of this life
path. It can indicate a karmic reason for a dramatic change in location,
often one beyond your personal control, that is impressed upon you and
then alters the course of your life path, altering the development of
your personal identity.

**Proserpina 26**

Proserpina relates to altered states, mediumship, and psychic abilities
inherited through the maternal line. It can also indicate separation
from home. Proserpina can portend to where we diverge from our mothers.
House and sign placement of Proserpina shows where our destiny is most
different from the destiny of our mother. It can indicate similar
inheritances between mother and child, yet diametrically different
manifestations and uses of those inheritances. For example, Proserpina
in House 6 can indicate similarly dealt fortunes and circumstances
relating to lifestyle, occupation, and daily routine in both mother and
child, but how the mother’s life actually manifested as a result of
those fortunes and circumstance is completely different in appearance
from how the child’s life manifests as a result of those same exact
fortunes and circumstances.

When Prosperpina is in the ascendant house, expressing the inner core of
who you are, we see someone born with or inheriting the ability to alter
states for mediumship, shamanism, or other forms of between-worlds
connections. Such an ability may descend from the maternal line of your
family.

Proserpina rising can also prognosticate complex yet karmic relations
between mother and child. Specifically, it is an indication of same
departure point different, diverging destinations. You and your
biological mother were likely to have been born from the same state,
same point of departure, but what she did with her life and what you do
with your life are diametric opposites, diverging significantly from one
another to form two entirely separate outcomes. Moreover, destiny
suggests that you and your own child will start from the same point of
departure but your child will take a diametrically different path from
you and therefore diverge and end at an entirely different destination.

**  
**

**Psyche 16**

Psyche relates to childhood wounds. House and sign placement of Psyche
indicate where there could be subconscious or latent childhood trauma,
injury, pain, and loss. Shadow work or inner reflection and
psychological self-improvement exercises might include assessment of
Psyche in one’s birth chart. For example, Psyche in House 5 or 7, Leo or
Libra, or in conjunct with Venus, the moon sign, or Juno can indicate
early adolescent heartbreak or early childhood observance of marriage
troubles in parents that has a severe future effect on the native’s
outlook on love and marriage. Psyche in House 8 or Scorpio can indicate
suppressed issues relating to sex and sexuality. Psyche also relates to
extrasensory perception (ESP) and clairvoyance. A strongly positioned
Psyche or Psyche rising can indicate innate abilities with ESP or
clairvoyance.

Psyche rising or Psyche in the moon sign can indicate one bearing
childhood wounds, but as a result of karma or genetic inheritance, also
possesses strong extrasensory perception, or clairvoyance. One who bears
the sign of a Psyche ascendant is one with much stronger, extraordinary
powers of the mind; likewise when Psyche is in the sun sign or moon
sign. Psyche in close proximity with Mercury will also produce such
results.

**Sappho 80**

Sappho relates to kindred spirits and intimate male and male or female
and female bonds. Sappho shows our friendships. House and sign placement
of Sappho show where we find our closest friends and kindred spirit
companions. House and sign placement show where we share similarities
with our friends. House 2 or 10 placement of Sappho show that we
gravitate toward friends in the same socioeconomic class as we are;
House 8 or 9 placement of Sappho show that we gravitate toward friends
with the same spiritual, religious, or educational leanings as
ourselves; Sappho rising shows one who seeks out friends who are most
similar to your sense of identity. Sappho rising indicates one who can
count on your social network for love, support, and advocacy.

**Sisyphus 1866**

House and sign placement of Sisyphus can indicate areas of life where we
experience recurring problems. Sisyphus relates to where one is a
“slower learner,” meaning where we seem to repeat our mistakes.

Sisyphus rising can indicate a tendency to repeat your mistakes. With
Sisyphus in the ascendant house, you may be slower to understanding who
you are, to matters relating to self-discovery, and may for much of your
childhood, young adult, and even adult life, not really know who you
are. You may find self-discovery elusive, often feeling uneasy about
where exactly your place in society is. There can be a sense of feeling
like an outcast, not knowing where you belong, with Sisyphus rising.

**  
**

**Siva 1170**

Siva relates to both self-creation and self-destruction. It is
associated with sorcery, ceremonial magic, and the house and sign
placement of Siva indicates where one’s inner third eye is strongest.
House placement of Siva reveals where you see farther and with more
depth and foresight than others. House and sign placement of Siva brings
added power, prestige, competency, and potency in that corresponding
area of life or character traits. Siva rising or Siva in the sun or moon
signs can indicate one born with the gift of third sight, and who has
the potential to gain great power and prestige in your life path.

**Siwa 140**

Siwa relates to productivity. House and sign placement of Siwa can
indicate where we tend to be most productive. Siwa also relates to a
closeness with nature and the Earth. Siwa brings energies of abundance
to the area of life that is its house placement.

Those with Siwa rising in their charts, or Siwa in the sun or moon
signs, possess a strong command over nature and Mother Nature’s
elements. Siwa relates to productivity, so when Siwa is in the ascendant
house, we see great potential for a highly accomplished individual and a
productive member of society. Here is one who will make an important
contribution to the society at large.

**Terpsichore 81**

Terpsichore relates to athleticism, physical exertions, aerobic physical
work, and body image issues. House and sign placement can also indicate
where we are most self-conscious. Terpsichore in a Fire or Air house or
sign tends to show natives who are more physically active, whereas
Terpsichore in a Water or Earth house or sign tends to show natives who
prefer to be stationary.

**Tisiphone 466**

House placement of Tisiphone points to an area of life where you tend to
outrank others. Sign placement of Tisiphone points to character traits
that are most extraordinary in you, where you possess more of than
others. Tisiphone relates to the power of execution and justice.

Tisiphone rising is a sign of extraordinary personal power. It indicates
one with a strong power of mind. Tisiphone rising is a strong indicator
of one who is willful, fiercely independent, and heightened activity in
the mind at all times. Here is one who “thinks too much,” but also
possesses a renaissance spirit. Tisiphone rising is an astrological sign
of great creativity.

**  
**

**Toro 1685**

House and sign placement of Toro can indicate where we are more
assertive, perhaps even pushy. Toro relates to strength in competition
and victories. A prominently positioned Toro can show a competitive
nature or one more prone to victory and winning. A weakened Toro shows
one who is not competitive and who is disinterested in “being \#1.” An
ascendant Toro is the sign of one who is strong in competition, who
seeks and can rise to a position of prominence, and who has a potent,
willful, domineering persona. Toro rising can bring great accomplishment
when utilized constructively by a native.

**Urania 30**

Urania is the ability to conceptualize, abilities in research and
development, the sciences, rationalism, logic, theory, and brings
creative or innovative thinking. A strongly positioned Urania indicates
aptitude in the sciences, technology, engineering, or mathematic fields
and high intelligence. A weakened Urania can indicate one who is not as
interested in innovation, research, or academic rigor.

Urania rising reveals innate talents and gifts in research, innovation,
the sciences, rationalism, logic, logical analysis, theory, and brings a
creative or innovative way of thinking through problems. Urania in a
Fire sign can indicate high intelligence, mental alertness, a quick wit,
and curiosity for life. Urania in a Fire sign can indicate abilities in
research and development, science, technology, engineering, or
mathematics. Urania in an Air sign can indicate gifts or skills that can
be applied in writing, social causes, publishing, journalism,
broadcasting, media, politics, diplomacy, government, or public policy.
Those with Urania in an Earth sign will be more gifted in the areas of
design, asset management, management of resources, business, commerce,
and establishing or organizing institutions. Those with Urania in a
Water sign possess strong research and development abilities in the
areas of psychology, counseling, healing, relationships, and
metaphysical studies. Urania in an Earth or Water sign indicates those
who are going to be more spiritual in nature, who are values- or
tradition- oriented, and who are dedicated to familial and interpersonal
relations rather than ideas, concepts, or glory.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image87.jpeg" style="width:1.02555in;height:1in" />

**Vesta 4**

Vesta determines our attitudes toward sex and sexuality at the visceral,
subconscious level. Vesta’s close proximity to Venus or Mars intensifies
sexual attraction, whereas closeness to the natal Saturn indicates a
cold, reserved nature and prudence. A strongly positioned Vesta, such as
residency in the ascendant house or close proximity to the sun or moon
can indicate healthy metabolism and intestines. A weakened Vesta can
indicate poor metabolism. Vesta rising in a birth chart can be the sign
of a priestess or female spiritual leader. Vesta rising shows one
dedicated to matters relating to home and hearth, who is family oriented
and who champions passionately for family values. Vesta rising is the
sign of one who is deeply and reverently dedicated to faith.

I read Vesta in a chart through the filter of religious belief or
religious devotion. The appeal of institutionalized religion is linked
to satiating common desires that humans have, including the desire to
feel accepted, the desire to feel a sense of social belonging, a desire
for idealism to be validated, a sense of power that has the ability to
improve your life, and many other desires are fulfilled by religious
belief. Read Vesta in a chart as an astrological indicator of how
important a role religion might play in the native’s life.

## Calculating Moon Phases

The phase that the moon was in on the day of your birth is said to give
some insight into your natal personality, the traits that fuel the
course of thought in your subconscious mind. Those born under a new moon
are fresh faced and ready for action when they’re born. They tend to be
focused inward, on their own interests, their own pursuits, and less
interested in social involvement. Waxing moons bring a rational,
go-getter, results-oriented drive. The full moon brings sensitivity,
stronger intuitions, and a spiritual quest for self-discovery. Waning
moons bring pensiveness, a more cerebral nature, and philosophical or
ideological thought.

| Degree difference between sun and moon |     |      | Moon phase         |
|----------------------------------------|-----|------|--------------------|
| 1°                                     | to  | 44°  | New moon           |
| 45°                                    | to  | 89°  | Crescent moon      |
| 90°                                    | to  | 134° | First quarter      |
| 135°                                   | to  | 179° | Gibbous moon       |
| 180°                                   | to  | 224° | Full moon          |
| 225°                                   | to  | 269° | Disseminating moon |
| 270°                                   | to  | 314° | Last quarter       |
| 315°                                   | to  | 360° | Balsamic moon      |

You can gauge the moon phase at the time of your birth by calculating
the distance between your sun and moon. Locate the sun in your birth
chart and then locate your moon. Moving **counter-clockwise**, count the
degrees between your sun sign and moon sign. You can then assess your
natal moon phase based on the above reference chart.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image89.jpeg" style="width:1.0442in;height:1in" />

| Degree difference between sun and moon |     |     | Moon phase |
|----------------------------------------|-----|-----|------------|
| 1°                                     | to  | 44° | New moon   |

**NEW MOON.** Those born during a new moon tend to be spontaneous, live
for the moment, and may forget to plan for tomorrow. They tend to rely
on their intuition rather than discernment or logical reasoning. They
like to try to navigate life without a map.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image90.jpeg" style="width:1.03641in;height:1in" />

| Degree difference between sun and moon |     |     | Moon phase    |
|----------------------------------------|-----|-----|---------------|
| 45°                                    | to  | 89° | Crescent moon |

**CRESCENT WAXING MOON.** Those born during a crescent moon, or crescent
waxing, may experience more struggles in life and endure recurring
growing pains. It takes a great deal of effort for them to achieve their
goals. Emotional baggage can follow them around. Those born under a
crescent waxing moon are also more likely to be late bloomers. In their
youths, they need to be challenged beyond and outside of their comfort
zones so they learn how to be bolder, more assertive, and confident.
Struggles with self-confidence can be a concern for those born during a
crescent waxing moon.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image91.jpeg" style="width:1.0379in;height:1in" />

| Degree difference between sun and moon |     |      | Moon phase    |
|----------------------------------------|-----|------|---------------|
| 90°                                    | to  | 134° | First quarter |

**FIRST QUARTER MOON.** The first quarter moon is auspicious for those
who work in crisis management. These are individuals who are born
managers. They know how to delegate tasks. They work well under
pressure. They can be relied upon to rise to any occasion. Those born
during a first quarter moon are action-oriented pioneers, trailblazers,
and heroes.

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image92.jpeg" style="width:1.04082in;height:1in" />

| Degree difference between sun and moon |     |      | Moon phase   |
|----------------------------------------|-----|------|--------------|
| 135°                                   | to  | 179° | Gibbous moon |

**WAXING GIBBOUS MOON.** Gibbous moons, or the waxing gibbous moon,
brings perfectionism, an eye for detail, and sharp, analytical skills.
Gibbous moon births prognosticate scholarship. These are going to be
truth-seeking and knowledge-seeking individuals. Children born during a
gibbous waxing moon are more inquisitive, curious, and intelligent.
They’re alert and quick.

| 180°                                   | to  | 224° | Full moon  |

**FULL MOON PHASE.** Full moon births prognosticate those who are on a
spiritual quest. Relationships are important to those who were born
under a full moon. They tend to be idealists, romantics, and are more
likely to ask the big questions in life, turning to religion,
spirituality, or mysticism for answers. These are the folks who are in
search for the meaning of life and in that search, might overlook the
minutiae and details of everyday living. They tend to be dreamers and
visionaries.

| 225°                                   | to  | 269° | Disseminating moon |

**DISSEMINATING MOON (WANING GIBBOUS).** A disseminating moon, or waning
gibbous moon, is called the “disseminating” moon because it is related
to those who disseminate information, knowledge, and data. These
individuals who are born under the waning gibbous are born
communicators. Their purpose in life is to spread ideas. You’ll find
many teachers, writers, philosophers, publicists, reporters, and
journalists with a disseminating moon. However, there can be a tendency
toward depression, ennui, or apathy with the disseminating moon, or this
notion that these individuals “think too much.”

<img src="F:\Obsidian Vaults\Grimoire Vault\Grimoire\media\image95.jpeg" style="width:1.0379in;height:1in" />

| Degree difference between sun and moon |     |      | Moon phase   |

| 270°                                   | to  | 314° | Last quarter |

**LAST QUARTER MOON.** Those born during a last quarter moon may
experience a mind-body disconnect, or identity issues. They also tend to
live in their own world, or an alternate universe that is off the beaten
path. Last quarter moon births can prognosticate introverted natures,
non-conformity, and those who are born “different.”

| Degree difference between sun and moon |     |      | Moon phase    |
|----------------------------------------|-----|------|---------------|
| 315°                                   | to  | 360° | Balsamic moon |

**BALSAMIC MOON (WANING CRESCENT).** Balsamic moons, or the waning
crescent moon, will indicate strong karmic influences over the native’s
life. Here we find visionaries and also, oftentimes, loners. Those born
under a balsamic moon tend to be intense. Many indigo children,
starseeds, or those wise beyond their years are found to have balsamic
moon births. Wisdom and heightened spiritual cultivation are related to
the balsamic moon.

In horary astrology, or using a chart for divination, identifying moon
phase can also be helpful. New moon indicates initiations; a waxing moon
indicates growth potential; a waning moon could indicate the need to
revise, reflect, or review; and a full moon can prognosticate power
potential.

When you have an astrological chart on hand, you can calculate the moon
phase at that moment by referencing the above chart. It’s worth your
while to include consideration of the moon phase and its implications
when reading an astrological chart.

## Zodiac Signs and Isopsephy

Isopsephy is a form of numerology that dates back to at least the 8th
and 9th centuries A.D. It is the esoteric practice of adding the
numerical values of letters in particular words or names to form a
single number, called a theosophic reduction. It is believed that the
theosophic reduction of a word or name vibrates with particular
metaphysical energies from the god principle, and so understanding that
vibration can help an individual understand his or her life purpose.

Another form of isosephy is to perform a theosophic reduction that
assigns a number to a zodiac sign, and so we integrate numerology with
astrology. The alpha-numerical zodiac sign attributions are as follows:

| *Element* | *Sign*      | *Number* | *Letter* | *Number* | *Letter* | *Number* | *Letter* |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Fire      | Aries       | 1        | **A**    | 13       | **M**    | 25       | **Y**    |

| Earth     | Virgo       | 6        | **F**    | 18       | **R**    |          |          |

| Fire      | Sagittarius | 9        | **I**    | 21       | **U**    |          |          |

*Note.* The most accurate way to use the foregoing compatibility chart
is by the ascendant signs of the two individuals. However, the chart is
still functional and informative by sun sign.
