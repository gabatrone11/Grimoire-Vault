**About the Course**

**_Short of It:_** The “final project” for this course is to produce your own astrology journal or grimoire, which I’m going to suggest compiling in the format of a 3-ring binder. I’ll give you a ton of templates, handouts, and media to help you get started on how to organize such a thing. But before we get to the destination, which is the grimoire, the “final project,” we are going to go through instructional material by way of 500+ pages of workbook reading and exercises. This course is taught primarily through The Workbook. There are also a couple of video lectures to help you navigate all this info overload.  

**_Long of It…._** Okay, breathe. You ready? Here we go… 

**The Initial Skim-Through**

Begin by scrolling through the entirety of the workbook or turning it from cover to cover, page by page, skimming and glancing through the contents. If you feel compelled to stop and read a section, keep it limited.

You don’t have to know or understand what you’re looking at as you make your way through the many pages. Just try to get that snapshot into your mind as-is. Again, doing so prepares your brain for the work ahead and even if you do not consciously remember what you’re glancing through, some part of your brain will.

The main purpose for this initial skim is to get your brain to begin programming an overview skeleton of the subject matter. Then later as you commence intensive study, your brain is simply filling out that internal framework.

For those from magical schools and mystery traditions, it's akin to building an inner temple, but here, it's more academic in focus and the objective is memory retention.

For those who are like "omg, what, you people really believe in magic?", what I am telling you to do has been proven by psychologists to be a powerful study technique for memory retention. Knowingly or instinctively, the best and brightest academic students will do this with their coursework and as a result, appear to have a photographic memory that allows them to excel in examination at levels surpassing their peers.

Regardless of the vocabulary we use, this is a subconscious yet effective measure for memory retention and learning. Plus, doing this recommended initial skim-through will give you a broad overview and roadmap for where you’ll be headed for the course, so at all times, you know where all this is going.

Think of it this way. You are trying to build a body of astrological knowledge in your mind. If you just start from page one without having done this initial skim-through and having given your brain a chance to program into itself that internal framework, it's like constructing a house without a blueprint, a plan, or even having a clear idea of what your house will look like in the end. You're pretty much setting down the first stone and hoping for the best. Your brain will in effect collect the bits of information as you feed it one by one and place it wherever the F it wants to place it. Later when you go back to retrieve that information, it can be harder. That's why memory retention is harder.

By doing that careful initial page by page skim-through, you're in effect getting your brain to create a blueprint and giving it clear architectural instructions. Then when you return to page one and begin your studies, your brain can pinpoint where in the architectural instructions you're at and construct the house you're instructing it to construct. The final result is a much more stable, more permanent structure of knowledge within.

So do not neglect this step. It’s a mental thing. It’s effective. And you can transfer this practice over to all other areas of study, especially if you're still in school. You’re welcome.

  

**Video #1: Introduction**

Once you’ve got a handle on the workbook files, begin the introductory video.

Click here to watch the private, unlisted video on YouTube: 

[https://youtu.be/vPXDzcyyh5E](https://youtu.be/vPXDzcyyh5E)

**Start on the Workbook**

After Video #1, open up your workbook and scan through the Table of Contents.

Read the “Introduction.”

Next read “Chart Purposes: Uses for Astrology.”

Read “Astrological Systems.”

Read “Anatomy of a Tropical Zodiac.”

Also, be sure to do all of the prompted review exercises in those sections. Check out the file folder of practice charts I’ve provided you with. Each chart is clearly labeled as Tropical Placidus, Tropical Whole Signs, Sidereal (Lahiri) Placidus, or Sidereal (Lahiri) Whole Signs. Glance through some of these sample charts and start spotting differences between the various systems and paradigms.

Before moving on to “Chart Shape Analysis,” let’s get to starting on that astrology grimoire of yours.

**There is no need to print everything from this file folder. Please check the file and make discretionary decisions on your own as to what you would like to print out and include in your grimoire binder and what you won't need.**

  

**Video #2: Astrology Journal & Workbook**

When you’re done watching the introductory video and checking through the download of astrology grimoire files to make sure you have everything, go on to this quick orientation video on assembling the journal and how to navigate the workbook.

**_Optional_****: Seven Day Ritual for Initiation into Astrological Studies**

For those who may find such a ritual to be helpful, I’m providing notes on a personal initiation to help bring energetic support to advance your studies. Click on the below links to download the files.

DOCX: Optional Seven Day Ritual for Initiation into Astrological Studies 

[https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/optional-seven-day-ritual-for-initiation-into-astrological-studies.docx](https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/optional-seven-day-ritual-for-initiation-into-astrological-studies.docx)

The objective of such a ritual is to figuratively draw down the planetary energies for support. Each planet or luminary from the Sacred Seven represents a specific metaphysical compendium of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding associated with that planet or luminary. Drawing down its planetary energies in a ritualistic, intentional manner will infuse you with the support of such energies. The infusion will push forward your advancements in study…if that makes any sense…

If you won’t want to hear the woo, then let’s talk psychology. Such a personal ritual will help you to set clear intentions and when our intentions are clear, our conduct is deliberate, exacting, and perfected. When our intentions and conduct are clear, we are more likely to achieve our goals. I’m presuming one of your goals is to master astrology, which is why you’re taking this course.

**The Journal: Your Eight Section Tabs**

For your first set of eight tabs, which will cover beginner astrology and this course, label the eight tabs as follows, in this order:

1.      Structure

2.      Signs

3.      Houses

4.      The Trinity

5.      Planets

6.      Sensitive Pts.

7.      Asteroids

8.      Miscellany

Beyond the scope of this course, but provided here in case you’re interested, after mastering beginner’s astrology a subsequent set of eight tabs can be added to your grimoire for intermediate and advanced study. Simply place the new set of eight behind the first set of beginner’s eight.

1.      Horary Astrology

2.      Synastry Astrology

3.      Sun Sign Horoscopes

4.      Past Life Astrology

5.      Spiritual Astrology

6.      Medical Astrology

7.      Chart Rectification

8.      All Checklists

_Note._ If and when you move on to acquire the additional set of eight tabs, I’d switch out “Miscellany” from the beginner eighth tab with “All Checklists” from the advanced eighth tab. That way the very last and final tab of your grimoire is always the “Miscellany” file.

Must you follow my suggested tab organization? Nope. You don’t. That’s why blank templates for section cover pages are provided, so you can customize your grimoire to your heart’s content.

**File Folder of Practice Charts**

I’m providing you with a file folder of birth charts for public and historical figures to practice your readings on. A few event charts for transits reading practice are also provided.

**There is no need to print everything from this file folder. Please check the file and make discretionary decisions on your own as to what you would like to print out and which sample public figure charts you want to practice on.**

Click here to download the zip file:

[https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/astrology-course-practice-charts.zip](https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/astrology-course-practice-charts.zip)  

Check: After download, the file folder titled “Astrology Course Practice Charts” should have a total of 142 JPG image files.

For the practice exercises provided in the workbook, do bonus practice exercises for yourself by running the same prompts and questions through select practice charts from this file. Choose any that interest you, Placidus or Whole Signs, and learn to spot what the practice exercise prompt is asking you to spot in many different charts.

_Example._ You get to the section on the midheaven, a key personal sensitive point in a chart. Dive into the practice charts and pull up the charts of some of the notable public figures you’re more interested in. Practice reading their midheaven signs and support your practice with publicly accessible biographical information about these public figures. Do the same with the various astrological houses and other features in the charts.

**Resume Workbook Study**

Return to the workbook and continue on with the section “Chart Shape Analysis.”

After studying that module and running through the review exercises, open the file folder of practice charts, select any at random, and practice identifying the chart shapes. Check your own natal chart and identify your chart shape.

From there, continue on with the workbook page by page in the order of topics presented.

Go at your own pace and as you make your way through each section, after finishing a section, jump over to your astrology grimoire to see what you want to add to your astrology grimoire. Begin the process of filling out and assembling your astrology grimoire as you make your way through each new section of the workbook.

**Mark Up the Workbook Pages**

Feel comfortable adding sticky tabs, post-it notes, and highlights to the workbook pages. Having an active engagement with the text is the best way to learn the course material. There’s also an energetic reason to do so: you’re integrating your energy with the energy of the book, which amplifies and mutually supports the power of both. On the mundane level, it’s why academic students who actively engage with their textbooks, outline and take notes, highlight and add sticky-tabs tend to excel more than their counterparts who don’t take on an active engagement with the text.

Look: you have the PDF. If at some future point you really want to print it all out again for a clean copy, you can totally do so! So don’t be afraid to dive in there and mark up, underline, highlight, and sticky-tab those pages.

**Assembling Your Astrology Grimoire**

This is by far the most important part of the course and the most pivotal practice of your study. You absolutely cannot get the most out of this course I’ve provided you with if you do not put together and then work on your personal, totally customized astrology grimoire.

As you work through the course, “take notes” in the astrology grimoire by adding content from the book into the grimoire. This active and manual practice of regurgitating information will help you to retain the knowledge.

Also, customize and style your personal astrology journal in a way that will reflect _you_. In the future, this journal will become your go-to reference manual for all things astrology.

Astrology itself is the tempered combination of science and art. Your astrology grimoire should reflect that principle. Aspire for your astrology grimoire to be a tempered combination of specialized knowledge and personal creativity.

**Recommended Syllabus: 12-Week Study Program**

As a student, I love self-paced independent study courses because I know my personal study pace does not always align with the majority. If that is the same with you, then there is no need to heed this recommended study pace. This section is here exclusively for those who feel like they need some tangible direction.

If you’d like a recommended road map for navigating the course content, here you go. The following is a PDF to a recommended syllabus:

[https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/astrology-course-for-beginners-recommended-syllabus.pdf](https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/astrology-course-for-beginners-recommended-syllabus.pdf)

**Check-In: Your Personal Astrology Grimoire**

By this point you should have a rather meaty, workable personal astrology grimoire and it should be coming along quite nicely from both a creative perspective and a knowledge-accruing one. You’re really proud of the substantive content you’ve assembled and it’s starting to shape up quite comprehensively. You’re also really proud of how it _looks_ and _feels_ energetically in your hands.

I’m intentionally sounding like a broken record about your damn journal because it is essentially your “final project” for this course. From my view, it’s the _whole point_ of this course. My whole point wasn’t to teach you astrology; it was to teach you how to teach yourself astrology. After you and I part ways and you’ve completed the course, from that point on, it’s your astrology grimoire that will be doing all the teaching. =)

**Video #3: Closing Remarks**

Once you’ve completed the workbook, please watch the final video on integrating astrology into everyday life and other metaphysical practices.

Click here to watch the private, unlisted video on YouTube:

Time stamps for the various topics covered in the closing video are as follows:

00:00   Review of What You Have Learned

01:42   Astrology & Everyday Life

08:32   Astrology & Craft

13:03   Astrology & Tarot

17:37   Formulating Your Systematic Approach to Astrology

28:15   Where to Go From Here

**Downloading the Three Videos**

I don’t have any problem with you keeping your personal copy of the three videos for this course, though my personal opinion is you don’t really need them. The other problem is I don’t know how to send them to you. Altogether the three video files add up to 5.10 GBs. Not only do I have no idea why three measly MP4 videos add up to so much space, but I also don’t know how to send them to you since nothing I have access to will let me upload 5.10 GBs. If there are any techies among you who have a solution, I’m all ears. If you really, really want a copy of the three videos for some reason, let me know and we’ll see about figuring something out.

A better option is to simply take notes while you watch the video and write down anything that you want to retain for yourself. Most of the videos are about course logistics anyway, so I just don’t think it’s necessary to have them.

  

**Please Do Not Share These Files and Links**  

We run on an honor system around here. Our relationship is one built upon trust. Please do not violate that trust. I will be very upset if any of these files are made public, circulated to the public, or shared with anyone who has not purchased the course files from me. Not heeding these simple, reasonable conditions will be construed as an unethical, exploitive act that breaches our sacred honor system.

  

**Addendum #1**

White Moon Selena (April 13, 2017)

The following handout linked below is on how white moon Selena's sign positioning is calculated. This isn't until Volume 2 (if you're working out of the two-volume set) and not until the mid-point of your single volume workbook when you get to the personal sensitive points, so if you're not there yet, just file this away until you do get to white moon Selena.

Selena Handout: [https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/201704-13-calculating-white-moon-selena.pdf](https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/201704-13-calculating-white-moon-selena.pdf)

This is really more of a "the more you know" and "for curiosity's sake" handout that should actually belong in an intermediate course on astrology rather than a beginner's, which is why it's not in the workbook, but added here for those of you gunners who like to do extra credit work.

**Addendum #2**

Character Strengths, Positive Psychology, and the Zodiac (May 31, 2017)

The following handout linked below is a synthesis of a psychological framework under the branch of positive psychology devised by Martin Seligman and my own zodiacal associations for these character strengths as outlined by Seligman.

Positive Psychology and the Zodiac Handout: [https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/2017-05-31-positive-psychology-and-the-zodiac.pdf](https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/2017-05-31-positive-psychology-and-the-zodiac.pdf)

**Addendum #3**  

Saturn Returns (January 5, 2018)

**_If you're between the ages of 28 and 31, or you're between the ages of 56 and 60, or between 84 and 90, just click on the free Saturn Return calculator link below to at least check out your dates. You might just be at around that time of one of your Saturn Returns._**

The following PDF handout is a free download that will be made available on my website with a companion video on Saturn Returns. It’s scheduled to be published on March 18, 2018, which happens to be my baby sister’s birthday, and also the start of her First Saturn Return.

[https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/your-saturn-return-survival-kit-benebell-wen1.pdf](https://benebellwen.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/your-saturn-return-survival-kit-benebell-wen1.pdf)

You are getting this file ahead of the public, however. There’s another reason I’m sending this to you at this moment and talking about it to you.

Most of you are spiritual entrepreneurs or professional readers of some kind or nature.

Professionally, one preliminary act of due diligence when you are working with a client, especially for an in-depth session, is to check date of birth in any free Saturn Return calculator and see if the present moment corresponds with a Saturn Return, Saturn Opposition, or Saturn Square.

Here is a free online Saturn Return calculator I found that I like, and which generates dates that align with what my professional astrology program tells me:

[http://www.rainbowcircle.f2s.com/Saturn/return.html](http://www.rainbowcircle.f2s.com/Saturn/return.html)

Let’s say Tabby comes to you for an in-depth divinatory or spiritual-guided session. I might consider taking a moment prior to Tabby’s session time with you to input her birth data and see if at present (or in the near future or recent past) there is anything going on with her Saturn.

If yes, it may help to inform at least one of the contributing factors to what’s going on in Tabby’s life path at the moment that has brought her to you for the session.

Now, about the PDF I just gave you, “Your Saturn Return Survival Kit.” Please feel absolutely free to integrate any facet of what’s provided there into your professional practice or as part of your consultation to your clientele. No need to give credit back to me or attribute me in any way.

Although I’m granting the Survival Kit to the public under a Creative Commons attribution license (that means anyone is free to use, distribute, share, or integrate the content, so long as clear, unambiguous attribution and credit is given to me along with a link to my website), for you, that is not the case! Please feel free to use without requirement of attribution.

If you feel anything in the Survival Kit resonates or aligns with your professional practice, please feel free to use it, change it and reinvent it, or work with it for your clients in the capacity as their spiritual counselor.

Can you craft and sell an oil or bath salts inspired by my recipe to help customers and clientele you interact with to navigate Saturn Returns? Yes. Do you need to attribute or credit me if you do? Nope.

Can you use the sigil design and integrate that into your professional consultations for your clientele? Yes. Do you need to attribute or credit me if you do? Nope.

Can you use any part of the handout, in part or in whole, edited, changed around, reworded, restructured, etc., to create your own content to distribute to your clientele? Yes. Do you need to attribute or credit me if you do? Nope.

However, all I ask is that you not make your work public or published prior to March 18, 2018. In a private counseling or consultation capacity, yes, yes please free to do as you will. I'm sure many of you practitioners right now are engaging with clients or even friends navigating critical Saturn transits. I hope this resource will give you more tools for helping such folks.

Thank you and productive journeying ahead.

Toward a greater collective,

B.
